## Addicted Approach
For some, the consumption of substances is the entirety of their life. For berserkers of the Addicted Approach, substances cause their fury to burn stronger and deeper, granting significant benefits.

### Slythmonger Savvy
When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in your choice of brewer's kit or spicer's kit. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid the low or addiction to substances. Lastly, you can consume substances as a bonus action, and when you do so, you can also enter a rage as a part of this same bonus action.

### Freedom Through Slavery
Also at 3rd level, while you are raging or experiencing the high of a substance, you have advantage on saving throws that would force you to act against your will, be frightened, or prevent you from attacking a creature. If you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, you are instead immune to effects that would force you to act against your will or would prevent you from attacking a creature.

### Release the Beast
At 6th level, while you are raging or experiencing the high of a substance, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a Hit Die to deal additional damage to the target. Roll the Hit Die, adding the result of the die to the damage roll. If you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, you also add your Constitution modifier to the damage roll.

### Seeing Sound
Starting at 10th level, while you are raging or experiencing the high of a substance, you have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. If you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, you instead have blindsight with a range of 30 feet.

### Fuel the Rampage
At 14th level, while you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, having 0 hit points doesn't knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don't die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.

## Ballistic Approach
For many, rushing an opponent with guns blazing is a last resort. For Berserkers of the Ballistic Approach, this isn't a last resort; it's the primary plan. Leading with a blaster and pure, unbridled rage, the berserker never lets an empty gun diminish their fury.

### Firestorm
When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in martial blasters with the burst or rapid property. Additionally, you've learned to use ranged weapons with untold fury. While wielding a blaster with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- When making a ranged weapon attack while within 30 feet of your target, you use your choice of Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
- When you use a blaster as an improvised weapon, you are considered proficient with it.

### Explosive
Also at 3rd level, while raging, you gain the following benefits:
- When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack made with a blaster weapon, you can reroll the die<br> and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is<br> a 1 or a 2.
- You add your rage damage to damage rolls<br> from ranged weapon attacks while within 30<br> feet of your target. You may only apply your<br> rage damage to one target when you use the<br> burst property.

### Rampage
At 6th level, while raging, when you deal<br> damage with a blaster with which you are<br> proficient while within 30 feet of your<br> target, you can use a bonus action to move<br> up to half your speed towards your target. You<br> must end this movement closer to your target than you started. If you end this movement within 5 feet of your target, you can make one melee weapon attack with your blaster as a part of this bonus action.

### Down, Not Out
Starting at 10th level, when you are hit with an attack by a creature within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a single attack against that creature with a blaster with which you are proficient.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Brawn
At 14th level, when you use the burst property of a blaster with which are you proficient, you can apply your rage damage bonus to every target that takes damage. Additionally, when a creature fails the saving throw against your burst or rapid property, it is knocked prone.

## Bloodstorm Approach
The Bloodstorm Approach is said to have originated from the ancient wookiee Hroufrasnooohn clan (which loosely translates to Bloodstorm in Galactic Basic), whose warriors performed gravity-defying feats with their flying vibroaxes through a combination of unorthodox techniques and a mystical belief in their own abilities. A berserker who follows this approach can hurl their devastating weapons at enemies with such power and skill that it completely blurs the line between melee and ranged combat.

### Furious Throw
When you choose this approach at 3rd level, your throwing techniques have become a perfect extension of your melee prowess. You may count your thrown weapon attacks as if they were melee weapon attacks for the purposes of your class features and feats, such as your Berserker Rage and Reckless Attack abilities.

### Returning Attacks
Also at 3rd level, any weapon you throw can ricochet back to you at your command. When you make a thrown weapon attack, you may have the weapon fly back to your hand immediately after the attack.

### Throw Anything
At 6th level, your strength and mastery of throwing techniques has allowed you to throw vibroaxes as easily as others hurl vibrodaggers. When you are wielding a melee weapon that you have proficiency with, it gains the thrown property (range 20/60).

### Fling People
Starting at 10th level, you learn to throw creatures as easily as you throw your weapons. When you successfully grapple a creature, you may<br> immediately throw the creature:

#### Throw Friend
If the creature is a willing ally and volunteers<br> to be grappled, you throw the target into any unoccupied space within 60 feet. That creature<br> may immediately use its reaction to make one<br> melee weapon attack, adding your Strength<br> modifier to the attack's damage roll.

#### Throw Foe
If the creature is an opponent, you throw the target into any unoccupied space within 30 feet, where it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier and falls prone.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Raging Whirlwind
At 14th level, you can send your weapon spinning into a gravity-defying whirlwind of pain. Once per rage as an action, you may throw a weapon with the thrown property to a point you choose within 60 feet. The weapon fills the air as a cyclone in a 10 foot radius sphere centered on that point. A creature takes damage equal to the thrown weapon's damage + your Strength modifier + your Rage Damage when it enter's the whirlwind's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. This effect ends when you command the weapon to return to you as a free action or your rage ends.

## Brawling Approach
Most berserkers require weapons. For berserkers of the Brawling Approach, however, everything is their weapon.

### Fists of Fury
When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you've learned to hone your rage through your fists. You gain the following benefits:
- You are proficient with improvised weapons.
- Your unarmed strike damage increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).
- When you attempt to shove or grapple a creature, or make an attack against a creature with an unarmed strike or a weapon wielded in one hand on your turn, you can use your bonus action to make an unarmed strike, grapple, or shove against the same creature.

### Reckless Strikes
Also at 3rd level, while you are raging, not wearing heavy armor, and not wielding a shield, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon, you can choose to forgo your rage damage to make the attack a reckless strike.

Some of your reckless strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the reckless strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**Reckless Strike save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Strength modifier

</div>

___

#### Bracing Strike
You gain temporary hit points equal to your rage damage bonus. If the target is grappled by you, you instead gain temporary hit points equal to twice your rage damage bonus.

#### Punishing Strike
Your target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is deafened until the start of its next turn. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead incapacitated until the start of its next turn.

#### Staggering Strike
Your target must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (the target chooses the ability score to use). On a failed save, your target is pushed back 5 feet. If the target is grappled by you, it instead knocked prone.

### Shattering Strikes
At 6th level, you rage causes your strikes to overcome the hardest of materials. While raging, you gain the following benefits:
- Your unarmed strikes and improved weapons count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.
- Your unarmed strikes deal double damage against structures.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Stop Hitting Eachother
Starting at 10th level, you can grapple creatures two sizes larger than you, instead of one. 

Additionally, you can use creatures you have grappled that are at least one size smaller than you as improvised weapons. When you do so, when you hit with an attack using a creature as a weapon, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. While raging, you can instead use creatures your size or smaller as improvised weapons.

### Enforcer
At 14th level, when you would make an unarmed strike or attack with an improvised weapon with advantage, you can choose to forgo the advantage. If you do so, you score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Additionally, on a hit, you deal the maximum instead of rolling.

## Cyclone Approach
The Cyclone Approach empowers the berserker's ability to fight with weapons in each hand. Followers of this approach learn to move quickly to avoid attacks and can become a whirlwind of fury and steel, cleaving through hordes of enemies.

### Dual Wielder
When you choose this approach at 3rd level, when you engage in Two-Weapon Fighting, you can add your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) to the damage of your Two-Weapon Fighting attack as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.

### Double Swing
Also at 3rd level, once on each of your turns when you miss with an attack while raging, you can immediately make a melee attack with the weapon in your other hand. 

### Twisting Winds
At 6th level, your unpredictable movement makes you harder to hit and pin down. When you make a saving throw or ability checks to avoid being knocked prone, pushed, grappled, or restrained, it gains a bonus equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Mighty Leap
Starting at 10th level, the distance you can jump is doubled, and you do not provoke attacks of opportunity if you leave a hostile creature's reach while jumping.

### Tornado
At 14th level, you can become a tornado of attacks. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your regular attacks to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. If you are wielding a separate melee weapon in each hand, each successful hit against a target deals damage equal to the damage dice of both weapons + your ability modifier + any other modifiers.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

## Frenzied Approach
For some berserkers, rage is a means to an end—that end being violence. The Frenzied Approach is that of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

### Frenzy
When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A).

When you finish a long rest, you reduce your exhaustion level by 2 rather than 1.<br> Additionally, any effect that removes<br> exhaustion reduces your exhaustion<br> by 1 additional level.

### Mindless Rage
At 6th level, you can't be<br> charmed or frightened while<br> raging. If you are charmed or<br> frightened when you enter your<br> rage, the effect is suspended for<br> the duration of the rage.

### Intimidating Presence
Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence.<br> When you do so, choose one creature that you can<br> see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving<br> throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you<br> until the end of your next turn. On subsequent<br> turns, you can use your action to extend the<br> duration of this effect on the frightened creature<br> until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if<br> the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or<br> more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

### Retaliation
At 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

## Industrial Approach
While some berserkers are content to surrender to their rage, others prefer a more tactful approach. Berserkers of the Industrial Approach augment their rage with the versatility of technology, adding elemental explosions to their already fearsome arsenal.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Techcasting
When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.

#### Tech Powers Known
You learn 4 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.

#### Tech Points
You have a number of tech points equal to half of your berserker level (rounded up), as shown in the Tech Points column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;table.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You may only cast tech powers at<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4th-level once. You regain the<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;ability to do so after a long rest.

#### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Techcasting Ability
Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___

<div align="center">

**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Intelligence modifier

___

**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br>your Intelligence modifier

</div>

___

#### Techcasting Focus
You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) as a techcasting focus for your tech powers.

### Industrious Tech
Also at 3rd level, you can cast tech powers while raging as long as the power's casting time is no more than 1 action, the power does not require concentration, and you are not wearing heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield. While raging, you add your rage damage to damage rolls from tech powers you cast. If a tech power damages more than one target, you may only apply your rage damage to one of the targets. 

Casting tech powers during rage counts as attacking for the purposes of maintaining rage, and you can use your Reckless Attack feature to gain advantage when casting a tech power that requires an attack roll.

\pagebreakNum

### Explosive Resilience
At 6th level, once per round, when you deal damage that includes your rage damage, you can cause a localized explosion around the recipient of that damage. Each creature within 5 feet of the damaged creature other than you takes acid, cold, fire, ion, or lightning damage (your choice) equal to your rage damage bonus, and you gain resistance to the chosen damage type until the end of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

### Painkiller
Starting at 10th level, whenever you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher, or deal damage using your Explosive Resilience feature, you can cause a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet to gain temporary hit points equal to half your berserker level (rounded up) + your Intelligence modifier. Additionally, while they have these temporary hit points, they have advantage on saving throws against effects that would cause them to be frightened.

### Final Countdown
At 14th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, and you have at least one tech point remaining, you can expend all your remaining tech points and instead to drop to one hit point. If you do so, each creature within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 10 acid, cold, fire, ion, or lightning damage (your choice) damage for each tech point spent in this way, or half as much on a successful one.

## Juggernaut Approach
Certain berserkers find that the strongest offense is a good defense. Berserkers of the Juggernaut Approach wear the heaviest of armor not because they fear injury, but to strike fear in their hapless attackers.

### Armored Brute
When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you've learned to fight in the heaviest of armors, using your weight to your advantage. You gain proficiency in heavy armor, and you can gain the benefits of your Rage feature while wearing heavy armor. 

When you reach 5th level, you can gain the benefits of your Fast Movement feature while wearing heavy armor.

### Unstoppable Force
Also at 3rd level, your momentum makes you nigh unstoppable. While raging, you can move through a hostile creature's space regardless of that creature's size. When you do so, you must make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check. If you move at least 10 feet before moving through a hostile creature's space, and that creature is your size or smaller, they have disadvantage on the check. If you succeed, you don't treat the movement as difficult terrain, the creature is pushed 5 feet in a direction of your choice, and you don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature until the end of your turn.

### Raging Bulwark
At 6th level, your imposing form acts as a shield for your allies. When a friendly creature you can see is<br> the target of a ranged attack, or forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, and you can see the source<br> of the effect, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed towards the friendly creature. You must end this move closer to the ally than you started. If you end this movement between your ally and the source of the effect, you provide cover for the attack.

Additionally, you provide three-quarters cover, instead of half-cover, to creatures your size, and you provide full cover to creatures smaller than you.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Overwhelming Cleave
Starting at 10th level, when you successfully push a creature into a surface or another creature while raging, the pushed creature takes kinetic damage equal to your Rage Damage. Additionally, the first time you hit with a melee weapon attack using Strength each turn, you can attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

### Relentless Assault
At 14th level, you're able to charge in unerring bursts. As an action, you can charge up to twice your speed in a straight line without provoking opportunity attacks. Each creature within 5 feet of your path must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier, the target chooses the ability they use use). On a failed save, a creature takes damage equal to your Strength modifier + your Rage Bonus and is pushed back 5 feet in a direction of your choice. Creatures smaller than you make this save with disadvantage. When you end this movement, if a creature is within 5 feet of you, you can make one melee weapon attack (no action required). On a hit, the creature takes additional damage equal to your berserker level.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete<br> a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Precision Approach
Some berserkers have learned to channel their rage into a method of increasing their focus and precision to supernatural levels. Those berserkers who choose the Precision Approach hone their rage to a fine point, becoming agile warriors who ruthlessly dispatch their foes.

### Careful Steps
When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you gain skills that represent your precise movement. You gain proficiency your choice of Acrobatics or Stealth.

### Focused Rage
Also at 3rd level, you hone your rage to a razor sharp focus. When you make a melee weapon attack using Dexterity, you add your rage damage to the damage roll. Additionally, you can use your Reckless Attack feature to give you advantage on melee weapon attacks using Dexterity during your turn.

### Exact Awareness
At 6th level, you gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws.

### Battle Anticipation
Starting at 10th level, while raging, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage against effects that you can see, such as traps and powers, you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

Additionally, while raging, melee weapon attacks using Dexterity score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

### Calm Within the Storm
At 14th level, the precision with which you act during your rage causes you to become a storm of reactive lethality. When you use your Reckless Attack feature, you can make a number of opportunity attacks equal to your proficiency bonus without using your reaction, and when a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack using Dexterity against that creature.

## Way of Endurance
The Force manifests in myriad ways; while some use the Force to manipulate the world around them, others use it to enhance themselves. Those consulars who follow the Way of Endurance channel the Force to allow them to overcome and reflect the most grievous of injuries.
 
### Upheld by the Force
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, the Force flowing through your body strengthens you, granting the following benefits:
- Your hit point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.
- Your base AC becomes 13 + your Constitution modifier. 
- When you make a melee weapon attack as a part of a force power you cast, you can use Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls.

Additionally, as an action, you can gain resistance to kinetic and energy damage for 1 minute. This effect lasts until you end it as a bonus action, you are incapacitated, or you don armor other than a shield. You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

### Retaliation Strike
At 6th level, you learn to turn<br> an opponent's aggression back<br> on them. When you deal damage<br> with a force power or a melee weapon<br> attack, if you took damage since the start<br> of your last turn, you deal an extra 1d6<br> damage. The damage is the same type as the<br> power or weapon's damage.

This die increases when you reach certain<br> levels in this class: to 1d8 at 10th level, to 1d10<br> at 14th level, and to 1d12 at 18th level.

### Boundless Vitality
Beginning at 10th level, when you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend a force point to regain health equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) as long as the damage would not reduce your hit points to 0. 

This die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d10 at 14th level, and to 1d12 at 18th level.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Unrelenting Resilience
At 14th level, when you use your Boundless Vitality feature while concentrating on a force power, you can add the result of the roll to the Constitution saving throw made to maintain concentration.

Additionally, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright while Upheld by the Force is active, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

### The Force Unleashed
Starting at 18th level, as an action, you can choose a point within 60 feet. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of that point must make a Constitution saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 force damage and suffers 1 level of exhaustion. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and does not suffer exhaustion.

For each creature that fails this saving throw, a friendly creature within 30 feet of them can regain hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt. A friendly creature can only gain this benefit once per turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Way of Manipulation
The power of the Force is both vast and diverse, with uses varying drastically based on their wielder. Those consulars who follow the Way of Manipulation learn to control their weapons with the Force, maneuvering them across the battlefield.

### Saber Storm
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn to deftly control your weapons utilizing the Force. As an action, you can initiate your Saber Storm. When you do so, select a melee weapon you wield, or one melee weapon within 5 feet that is not worn or carried by a conscious creature, and use the Force to cause it to levitate, acting as an extension of your will for 1 minute. When you activate this feature, you can cause the weapon to move up to 10 feet and make a melee force attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 + your forcecasting ability modifier damage. The type is of the normal damage dealt by the weapon. The weapon then returns to your side.

Your weapon moves with you, and while Saber Storm is active and you have a weapon animated, on each of your turns you can use an action to move a weapon up to 10 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. The weapon then returns to your side. Your Saber Storm ends early if you are incapacitated. At any time, you can end this feature and return the animated weapon to your hand.

Additionally, while your Saber Storm is active, and at least one animated weapon is within 5 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:
- You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1) if it doesn't already include that modifier.
- You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a power. The bonus equals your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1).

This feature can animate more than one weapon when you reach higher levels: two weapons<br> at 5th level, three weapons at 11th level,<br> and four weapons at 17th level. When<br> you use your action to attack with your<br> weapons, you can direct them at the<br> same target or at different ones. Make a<br> separate attack roll for each weapon.

At 5th level, the distance your weapon can travel increases to 20 feet. This distance increases to 30 feet at 11th level, and 40 feet at 17th level.

You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

### Deceptive Strike
At 6th level, when you cast a force power with a range of touch while Saber Storm is active, your animated weapon can move up to its range and deliver the power as if it had cast it. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Guarding Weapon
Beginning at 10th level, you can direct your animated weapons to absorb damage while your Saber Storm is activate. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to expend one force slot to have your animated weapon intercept it, and reduce that damage to you by an amount equal to five times the force slot's level.

### Isolate
At 14th level, when you deal damage to a creature while Saber Storm is active, and that creature fails a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a force power, you can steal and redirect the power. Until the end of your next turn, either you or the creature who failed the Constitution saving throw gain the effects of the power (your choice).

### Sapping Storm 
Starting at 18th level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points while Saber Storm is active, you gain temporary force points equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). These temporary force points can not exceed your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice), and when you would spend a force point while you have temporary force points, the temporary force points are spent first. When Saber Storm ends, you lose any remaining temporary force points.

## Way of Negation
Some force users seek mastery over the fundamentals of energy manipulation, known as tutaminis. Those consulars who follow the Way of Negation harness this power to limit the havoc that other force-wielders might wreak.

### Force Deflection
At 3rd level, when you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a +4 bonus to that saving throw.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

### Power Surge
Starting at 6th level, you learn to simultaneously limit a creature's force powers and store that power within yourself to later strengthen your damaging force powers.

You can store a maximum number of power surges equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). Whenever you successfully end a force power with a power such as *force suppression* or *sever force*, or use your Force Shield or Force Deflection features to successfully avoid an attack or succeed on a saving throw, you gain one power surge, as you redirect the flow of the Force into yourself. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

&emsp;Once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature or object with a force power, you can spend one power surge to deal extra damage to that target. The extra damage is of the same type as the power's damage, and it equals half your consular level (rounded down).

Whenever you finish a long rest, your number of power surges resets to one. If you end a short rest with no power surges, you gain one power surge.

### Enduring Focus
At 10th level, you can casually deflect attacks while channeling your power. While you are concentrating on a Force power, you have a +2 bonus to your AC and all saving throws.

Additionally, you can extend your Force Deflection to a creature within 5 feet of you when they fail a saving throw.

### Conflux
At 14th level, when you use your Force Deflection feature, you can cause a ripple in the Force to expand from you. Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you each take force damage equal to half your consular level.

### Staggering Stratagem
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your potency with the telekinetic power of the Force heightens. You can manipulate creatures of Large size or smaller with your force powers and Way of Telekinetics features.

This feature can affect additional creatures when you reach higher levels: two creatures at 11th<br> level and three creatures at 17th level.

### Size Matters Not
Beginning at 10th level, you can<br> manipulate creatures of Huge size or<br> smaller with your force powers and<br> Way of Telekinetics features.

## Way of the Seer
The Force guides us in innumerable ways, often manifesting as visions. Those consulars who follow the Way of Seer attempt to harness these visions in an attempt to work towards the best possible future, as they see it.

### Force Visions
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

### Powerful Mind
At 6th level, you can use your force abilities to read a creature's thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature's mind to command it.

As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can't use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest. If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about.) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute. During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and use the *coerce mind* force power on the creature without expending force points. The target automatically fails its saving throw against the power. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your<br> choice, a minimum of once). You regain<br> any expended uses when you finish a<br> long rest.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Visions of the Past
Beginning at 10th level, you can call up visions of the past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate surroundings. You spend at least 1 minute in meditation, then receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses of recent events. You can meditate in this way for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom score and must maintain concentration during that time, as if you were casting a force power. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Object Reading.*** Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object's previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.

***Area Reading.*** As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.

### Shielded Thoughts
At 14th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;same amount of damage that you do. 

### Clarity of Vision
Starting at 18th level, the visions in your dreams<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;intensify and paint a more accurate picture in<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;your mind of what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Force Visions feature, rather than two.

takes additional fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier and then makes a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC, ending this effect on a success. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames, the effect ends.

#### Powered Grappling Hook
_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook_<br>
While your wrist-mounted grappling hook is deployed, when you cast a tech power with a range of touch, your hook can deliver the power as if it had cast it.

#### Sentry Turret
You learn how to craft small sentry turrets shaped like globes that can adhere to any surface. As an action or bonus action (your choice), you can throw a sentry to a point you can see within range (30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5). At the end of each of your turns, a deployed sentry automatically targets a hostile creature within 10 feet of it. If multiple targets are available, one is chosen at random. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d4 energy damage and its speed is reduced by 5 until the end of your next turn.

The sentries have 1 hit point, an armor class of 10, and can be repaired over the course of a long rest. Each sentry lasts for 1 minute before deactivating. You can maintain a number of sentries equal to your Intelligence modifier. Once a sentry has been activated, it can't be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Experimental Engineering
Those engineers who choose the Experimental Engineering discipline create and use untested combinations, resulting in powerful—and often unpredictable—effects.

### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this discipline at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in a set of implements of your choice. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with tinker's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.

### Modified Tinkercannon
Also at 3rd level, you learn to enhance your tinker's implements with unproven science, modifying them into a backpack with a cannon. Over the course of a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of materials to modify your tinker's implements. You must have materials and tinker's implements in order to perform this modification.

Whenever you cast a tech power of 1st level or higher while wielding your tinker's implements, you risk unexpected complications. Your GM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the Experimental Engineering Surge table to create a random effect. 

Additionally, your tinker's implements come equipped with 4 overrides, and they gain more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. Each time you trigger an Experimental Engineering Surge, you can use an override to reroll the percentile dice. You must use the new result, you can only do this once per surge, and your<br> maximum tech points is reduced by 1 until<br> you complete a long rest. You regain all<br> expended overrides when you complete<br> a long rest.

### Unstable Volley
Lastly at 3rd level, as a bonus<br> action you can expend one<br> use of your Potent Aptitude<br> to launch a volley of unstable<br> energy at a surface located with-<br>in 30 feet of you that you can<br> see. This energy adheres to<br> the surface for 1 minute, after<br> which it erupts. As a part of this<br> bonus action, or as a bonus<br> action on each of your turns,<br> you can cause the energy<br> to erupt early. Each<br> creature within 5 feet<br> of it must make a Dext-<br>erity saving throw<br> against your tech save<br> DC. A creature takes<br> 1d6 lightning damage on<br> a failed save, or half as<br> much on a successful one. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

&emsp;This damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.

### Creative Destruction
Beginning at 6th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of +1) to any damage you deal with tech powers and class features. If the tech power or class feature would damage multiple creatures, you can only deal this additional damage to one of them.

If you choose to deal this additional damage, your GM can have you roll on the Experimental Engineering Surge table.

### Experimental Overrides 
At 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over your surges. Whenever you roll on the Experimental Engineering Surge table and use one of your overrides, you can choose either total.

### Engineering Bombardment
Starting at 18th level, the harmful energies of your tech powers and class features intensify. When you roll damage for a tech power or class feature and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, you can roll it again and use both results. You can only use this ability once per tech power or class feature.

## Adept Specialist
Those fighters who choose to become Adept Specialists tap into a latent Force-sensitivity to augment their martial prowess, blending the two to accelerate their bodies and blows. An adept speeds across the battlefield, attacking opponents in a flurry of blows before dashing off again.

### Forcecasting
When you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

#### Force Powers Known
You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Adept Specialist Forcecasting table.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

#### Forcecasting Ability
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___

<div align="center">

**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br>your forcecasting ability modifier

### Studied Shooter
When you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you learn specialized theory typical for practitioners of the enhancement trade. You gain proficiency in your choice of the Lore or Technology skills. Additionally, you learn your choice of the *encrypted message* or *minor image* tech power. Intelligence is your techcasting ability for these powers.  

### Special Ammunition
Also at 3rd level, you learn ammunition enhancements that are fueled by amplified shots to unleash special enhanced effects.

#### Ammunition Enhancements
You know two ammunition enhancements of your choice, which are detailed under "Ammunition Enhancements" below, and you earn more at higher levels. Many ammunition enhancements boost an attack in some way. Once per turn when you fire a shot from a blaster as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Ammunition Enhancement options to that shot,

You gain an additional Ammunition Enhancement option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.

Each time you learn new ammunition enhancements, you can also replace one ammunition enhancement you know with a different one.

#### Amplified Shots
You have two amplified shots, which you use to activate your ammunition enhancements. An amplified shot is expended when you use it. When you fire an amplified shot, your weapon is treated as enhanced for overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage. You decide to use the option when the shot hits a creature, unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll. You regain all of your amplified shots when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Saving Throws
Some of your ammunition enhancements require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**Ammunition save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br> your Dexterity modifier

</div>

### Ammunition Enhancements
The ammunition enhancements are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Carbonite Shot
When this shot strikes its target, shards of carbonite wrap around the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 cold damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 kinetic damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the carbonite with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Special Ammunition save DC. Otherwise, the carbonite lasts for 1 minute or until you use this option again.

The cold damage and kinetic damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

#### Coercing Shot
You enhance your shot with chemicals that confuse the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.

The poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

#### Explosive Shot
You fire a shot set to explode on impact. The shot detonates after your attack. Immediately after the shot hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 fire damage each.

The fire damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

#### Hallucinogen Shot
You enhance your shot with hallucinogenic chemicals. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.

The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

#### Piercing Shot
You enhance your shot with armor-piercing properties. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the shot shoots forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The shot passes through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.

The extra damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

#### Quell Shot
You fire a shot enhanced with a debilitating poison. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.

The poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

#### Seeking Shot
You apply a tracing signal to your shot. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The shot flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the shot to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the shot disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 kinetic damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location.

The kinetic damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

### Enhanced Shot
Beginning at 7th level, you gain the ability to enhance your shots. Whenever you fire an unenhanced shot from a blaster, you can make it enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.

### Redirected Shot
At 10th level, you learn how to direct an errant shot toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with an enhanced shot and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.

At 11th level, you learn how to enter a trance, preparing to unleash yourself upon your enemy. While in this trance, you can still talk and move. If you stay in the trance for at least one minute, when you roll initiative, you can make a ranged weapon attack on a number of creatures up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of one) within 30 feet of you when you were in this trance.

## Acquisitions Practice
Many operatives are hired for the procurement of valuable artifacts, but only the true masters of the art can slip through the tightest security and make off with untold riches, whether they do it for a profit, or for sport. Those operatives who choose the Acquisitions Practice apply a mixture of stealth and impressive acrobatics to surpass any kind of defenses they are met with.

### Fast and Agile
When you use choose this practice at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your demolitions kit or security kit to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

Additionally, climbing no longer costs you extra movement, and you gain the ability to move in flying leaps with incredible speed, precision, and power. When you move, instead of using your walking speed, you may take two short movements by flying. Each movement is at half your speed, and you must end each one on a solid object, a surface, or on the ground. If you do not, you fall and your movement ends. If you Dash, your bonus movement is applied to your normal speed, not this movement. 

### Deft Hands
Also at 3rd level, you learn a number of techniques to distract and confuse your opponents. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to perform a deft hand maneuver.

Some of your aerial maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the deft hand maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**Deft Hands save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Dexterity modifier

</div>

___

#### Hinder
You attempt to distract your target in order to hinder their movement. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, its movement speed is reduced by half and it makes the first Dexterity saving throw before the end of its next turn with disadvantage.

#### Pilfer
You attempt to pick your target's pockets. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you have advantage on the first Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check you make against the target before the end of your next turn.

#### Tumble
You attempt to nimbly roll away. You immediately move 10 feet in a direction of your choice, and the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from the creature.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Supreme Sneak
Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn. Additionally, as long as you aren't incapacitated, you no longer take damage from falling less than 100 feet, and have resistance to falling damage.

### Improved Aerial Agility
Starting at 13th level, your Aerial Agility feature improves and you gain the following benefits:
- When you move, you can instead take 3 short movements by flying.
- Whenever you end your flying movement and you are within 5 feet of a climbable surface, you can grab onto that surface as though you were climbing upon it.

### Thief's Reflexes
When you reach 17th level, you can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.

Additionally, you learn to utilize the momentum of your fall to make deadly vertical strikes. Whenever you fall at least 50 feet and land within 5 feet of an enemy creature you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against that<br> creature. If the attack is a<br> Sneak Attack, you can deal<br> three additional weapon<br> dice worth of damage and<br> the creature must make a<br> Dexterity saving throw<br> or be knocked prone.

#### Force Powers Known
You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may<br> learn a force power at the same time you<br> learn its prerequisite.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

#### Force Points
You have a number of force points equal to your operative level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table.

You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

#### Forcecasting Ability
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

### Fascinating Display
Also at 3rd level, you can spend 1 minute attemping to distract and enthrall those around you. Choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched your display for the duration, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, speaking glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it. Additionally, it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies.

If a target succeeds on this saving throw, the target has no hint you tried to charm it.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

### Mesmerizing Presence
Beginning at 9th level, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures charmed by you.

### Enthralling Vigor
Starting at 13th level, whenever a creature fails a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw against a force power or class feature you use, you can gain temporary hit points equal to half your operative level (rounded down) + your Charisma modifier (minimum of one).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

### Distracting Countenance
At 17th level, as a bonus action, you can mask<br> yourself with the Force for 1 minute or until<br> you are incapacitated. For the duration,<br> whenever any creature tries to attack<br> you for the first time on a turn, the<br> attacker must make a Charisma<br> saving throw (DC = 8 + your prof-<br>iciency bonus + your Charisma<br> modifier). On a failed save, it can't<br> attack you on this turn, and it<br> must choose a new target for its<br> attack or the attack is wasted. On<br> a successful save, it can attack<br> you on this turn, but it has<br> disadvantage on any saving<br> throw it makes against your<br> powers on your next turn.

Once you've used this<br> feature, you must com-<br>plete a short or long<br> rest before you can<br> use it again.

## Disabling Practice
Those operatives who choose the Disabling Practice utilize a variety of pushes, pulls, weight shifts, and joint locks to immobilize their opponent. They use these techniques to manipulate their opponent, moving them across the battlefield before incapacitating them.

### Clinch Strike
When you choose this practice at 3rd level, you learn how to discourage, debilitate, and harm your enemies. You gain the following benefits while you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor or a medium or heavy shield:
- Your unarmed strike damage increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).
- You can deal Sneak Attack damage when making an unarmed strike. Additionally, you don't need advantage on your unarmed attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if the target of your Sneak Attack is a creature grappled by you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.
- You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make an unarmed strike against a creature you are grappling.

### Skilled Grappler
Also at 3rd level, you learn a number of grappling techniques to subdue your opponents. When you hit a creature grappled by you with an unarmed strike and deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a grappling technique.

Some of your grappling techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the grappling technique's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

___

<div align="center">

**Grapple Technique save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br> your Strength modifier.

</div>

___

#### Constrict
You attempt to choke the target into<br> unconsciousness. The target must make a<br> Constitution saving throw or be restrained<br> until the end of your following turn.  

If you maintain this technique for 1<br> minute, the target falls unconscious for 1<br> hour. Droids and constructs can not be<br> knocked unconscious in this way.

#### Disarm
You attempt to disarm a weapon or other object the target is holding. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it releases the object. If you have a free hand, you can catch the object. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.

\columnbreak

<div style ='margin-top:27px'></div>

#### Hip Toss
You attempt to throw your target to the ground. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed back 5 feet, knocked prone, and stunned until the start of your next turn. This ends the grapple.

### Human Shield
Beginning at 9th level you learn to manipulate the body of a grappled target to make attacks against you more difficult to land. Moving a grappled creature the same size as you or smaller no longer halves your speed, and when a creature grappled by you would grant you half cover, you instead have three-quarters cover. Additionally, when you are hit by an attack while grappling a creature, you can use your reaction to force that attack to instead hit the grappled creature.

### Kiss the Wall
Starting at 13th level, you can use your surroundings to further punish the target of your grapple. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a Sneak Attack damage die for an unarmed attack you make against a creature grappled by you, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

### Neck Snap
At 17th level, you learn how to immediately remove your grappled opponent from the fight. As an action, you can force a creature grappled by you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, if the creature has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. If the target has more than 100 hit points, it immediately takes &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;10d10 kinetic damage. This damage can't be &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;reduced in any way.

Once&emsp;&emsp; you've used this feature, you must<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;complete a short or long rest before you can&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; use it&emsp;&emsp; again.

### Artful Dancer
When you choose this practice at 3rd level, your training with music and dancing grants you certain benefits. You gain proficiency in the Performance skill and one musical instrument of your choice.

Additionally, while you are you are not wearing armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield, you can add half your Charisma modifier (rounded up) to your AC as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.

### Dazzling Steps
Also at 3rd level, you learn to conduct impressive displays of grace and speed in combat. While you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield, and you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a weapon with either the light or finesse properties, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, and if you deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a dazzling step.

Some of your dazzling steps require your target to make a saving throw to resist the dazzling step's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

___

<div align="center">

**Dazzling Step save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Charisma modifier

</div>

___

#### Defensive Step
You defend yourself from further attack. Roll two Sneak Attack dice. You gain temporary hit points that last until the start of your next turn equal to the amount rolled.

#### Mobile Step
You twist and twirl around the target. The target must make a Strength saving throw. A Huge or larger creature automatically succeeds. On a failed save, it is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately move into the space it just vacated without provoking opportunity attacks.

#### Offensive Step
Choose another creature that you can see<br> within your reach. The creature must make a<br> Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, roll<br> two Sneak Attack dice. The creature takes<br> damage equal to the amount rolled. This<br> damage is of the same as your weapon's<br> damage.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Flexible Body
Beginning at 9th level, you are able to use your acrobatic talent to gain the upper hand in combat. You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to shove a creature. When you do so, you can make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check instead of a Strength (Athletics) check. 

Additionally, you now ignore difficult terrain, you can move through space occupied by hostile creatures, and you can squeeze through smaller spaces without expending extra movement.

### Dance of Death
Starting at 13th level, you can use your action to make a weapon attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. You can choose to deal Sneak Attack damage to each creature you hit, but you can only roll half your number of Sneak Attack dice (rounded up) per creature.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Master of Dance
At 17th level, your confidence when putting on a show has extended into combat. You add your Charisma modifier to initiative checks. Additionally, any creature who fails a saving throw against your Dazzling Step save DC has disadvantage on the first attack roll they make against you<br> each turn until the<br> end of your next<br> turn.

## Ruffian Practice
Those operatives who choose the Ruffian Practice use rough-and-tumble tactics to handle any fight, big or small. They incite chaos and make devious moves that keep their enemies reeling.

### Rakish Audacity
When you choose this practice at 3rd level, your unmistakable confidence propels you into battle. You can add your Charisma modifier to your initiative rolls.

Additionally, you don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if no creature other than your target is within 5 feet of you, as long as the target of the attack is within 5 feet of you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.

Finally, during your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.

### Nimble Step
Also at 3rd level, you learn to fluidly strike and maneuver through combat. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to maneuver across the battlefield.

Some of your fancy footworks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the debilitating strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

___

<div align="center">

**Nimble Step save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br> your Dexterity modifier.

</div>

___

#### Blade Defense
You attempt to determine your target's next strike. Roll two Sneak Attack dice, and the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your AC increases by the higher amount rolled on the dice against the first attack it makes against you before the start of your next turn. On a successful save, your AC instead increases by the lower amount.

#### Disarming Strike
You attempt to disarm a creature with your attack. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. If you have a free hand, you can catch the item. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.

#### Fancy Footwork
Roll two Sneak Attack dice. Your speed increases by 5 x the greater result of the two dice, and you ignore difficult terrain until the end of your current turn.

### Panache
Beginning at 9th level, your charm becomes extraordinarily beguiling. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

&emsp;If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can't make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a power, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart.

If you succeed on the check and the creature isn't hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.

### Elegant Maneuver
Starting at 13th level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during the same turn.

### Master Duelist
At 17th level, your mastery of the blade lets you turn failure into success in combat. If you miss with an attack roll, you can roll it again with advantage. Once you do so, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Tracker Droid Companion
Also at 3rd level, you learn to employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to create and customize your own personalized tracker droid companion.

Your tracker droid is detailed at the end of this practice. Over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of materials to finally finish your tracker droid.

If your tracker droid is irreparable destroyed, or you want to interface with a different tracker droid, you can spend an additional 250 credits and 1 hour to change the target of this feature. You may only have one tracker droid companion at a time.

Your tracker droid gains a variety of benefits while it is interfaced with you:
- The tracker droid obeys your commands as best it can. It acts on your turn, and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your tracker droid acts on its own.
- Your tracker droid's level equals your operative level, and for each operative level you gain after 3rd, your tracker droid companion gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly.
- Your tracker droid has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level.
- Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature in this class, your tracker droid's abilities also improve.

### Ion Pulse
Starting at 13th level, as a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one or more of your tracker droid's Hit Dice to have it emit an pulse of ion energy. Each creature within 5 feet of your tracker droid must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. A creature takes 1d4 ion damage for each Hit Die expended in this way on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. Any electronics not being worn or carried within the blast radius are disabled until rebooted.

### Sabotage
At 17th level, you gain the ability to sabotage a tech power in the process of being cast. When a hostile creature casts a tech power, and you are the target of the tech power or within its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make an Intelligence saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, the power is cast as normal.

On a failed save, you negate the power's effects, and the caster takes 1d6 lightning damage per level of the power it was casting. Additionally, on a failed save, the caster's tech focus used to cast the tech power is overloaded and can't be used to cast tech powers for 1 minute. 

At the end of each of the caster's turns, it can repeat the Intelligence saving throw. On a success, it can use the tech focus to cast tech powers again.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Sawbones Practice
Those operatives who choose the Sawbones Practice have studied the humanoid body on a more intimate level than other operatives. While others may know where best to stab in order to kill, you also know how to repair the wounds you inflict, as well as how to make them even deeper. You delve into the secrets of the body, learning as much medical knowledge as you can get your hands on, regardless of how dirty the work becomes.

### General Practice
When you choose this practice at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Medicine, and you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier for checks made with it.

Additionally, you can expend one use of a medkit to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

### Debilitating Strike
Also at 3rd level, you learn to apply your anatomical knowledge in direct combat, in order to hinder your targets. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to hinder the creature, provided they have the appropiate physiology.

Some of your debilitating strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the debilitating strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

___

<div align="center">

**Debilitating Strike save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

</div>

___

#### Bleeding Wound
You attempt to create a lingering wound in the target for one minute. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, at the start of each of the target's turns, it loses 1d6 hit points and repeats this saving throw, ending the effect on a success. This damage can't be reduced in any way.

#### Crippling Pain
You attempt to cause cause distracting pain in the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of your next turn. 

#### Hampering Shot

You are able to use a medkit or administer a medpac as a bonus action, and when you use a medkit to stabilize a dying creature, that creature also regains a number of hitpoints equal to your Intelligence modifier.

### Dosage Control
Starting at 13th level, your knowledge of medicine allows you to partition and ration healing supplies very effectively, without impacting its potency. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a rest, you can carefully measure and mark out dosages of a medpac within reach. The medpac can now be used twice before it is consumed.

At your DM's discretion, you may be able to use this feature on other pacs, stims, or adrenals, most likely involving an ability check to succeed.

### Self-Sustain

When you choose this pursuit at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in your choice of the Insight, Deception, Persuasion, or Sleight of Hand skills. Additionally, you gain proficiency in three gaming sets of your choice, and you have advantage on any ability check you make that uses any of these gaming sets.

### Risk versus Reward
Also at 3rd level, when you make your first attack on your turn against the target of your Critical Analysis feature, you can decide to gamble by rolling a d6. On a roll of 4 or higher, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the start of your next turn. On a roll of 3 or lower, that creature instead has advantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.

This die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 7th level, to 1d10 at 11th level, and to 1d12 at 15th level.

### Additional Maneuvers
Lastly at 3rd level, you gain access to new maneuvers which reflect your deep understanding of chance. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.

#### All In
When you make an attack roll, and the result is less than 20, you can expend a superiority die and roll it, adding it to the roll. If the resulting sum is 20 or 23,<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the attack is considered a critical hit.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

#### Blind Luck
When you fail an ability check, you can expend a superiority die. If the result of your ability check plus the superiority die is within a range equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) above or below the check's DC, you pass the check instead. 

#### Double Bluff
If on the same round of combat that you have missed a weapon attack, an enemy also misses you with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and make a single weapon attack, adding the results of your superiority die to both the attack and damage rolls.

#### The Idiot's Array
When a creature hits you with a weapon attack roll, you can expend a superiority die and roll it. On a roll of 4 or higher, you take minimum damage on the damage roll and subtract the value of the superiority die. On a roll of 3 or lower, you instead take the maximum.

#### Played Their Hand
When a creature hits you with an opportunity attack while within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack misses, you can make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the attacker's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity<br> (Acrobatics) check (their choice) as a part of this<br> reaction. On a success, the target drops the<br> weapon it made the attack with. If you are<br> within 5 feet of the target, and you have a free<br> hand, you can catch the item. Otherwise,<br> the object lands at its feet.

\pagebreakNum

#### Pure Sabacc 
When you score a critical hit with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and roll it. On a roll of 4 or higher, you deal maximum damage on the weapon's damage roll, including the superiority die. On a roll of 3 or lower, you instead deal the minimum.

#### Raise the Stakes
When the target of your Critical Analysis feature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die. Roll the die and subtract the result from the enemy's attack roll, but add the result to their damage roll on a hit.

#### Take a Chance
Before making an attack roll, you can expend a superiority die. On a miss, you lose that superiority die and do not benefit from it in any way. On a hit, you can choose two other maneuvers that you know, and subject the target to both maneuvers, without expending additional superiority dice.

#### Tiebreaker
When you roll a superiority die as a part of a maneuver you learned from this class, you can expend another superiority die and use the total of both dice.

### Lucky Number 7
Beginning at 6th level, whenever you roll a 7 on an attack roll against the target of your Critical Analysis feature, the attack automatically hits and you regain a superiority die. You can not have more superiority dice than the amount shown in the Superiority Dice column of the scholar table.

When attacking with advantage or disadvantage, this effect applies if either roll is a 7. If both rolls are a 7, the attack is a critical hit.

### Tell Me the Odds
Starting at 9th level, if the target of your Critical Analysis hits you with a weapon attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d8. On a 4 or higher, you impose disadvantage on the roll. If the target already had disadvantage, they must instead reroll one of the dice once (your choice).

This die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d10 at 11th level, and to 1d12 at 15th level.

### Borrowed Luck
Once you've reached 17th level, you have gained the ability to unnaturally alter luck in your favor. Once per round, after an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check is rolled by you or a creature that you can see, you can replace the number on the d20 with a 7. Note the number on the d20 of the roll that you replaced. That number becomes your borrowed luck roll.

While you have a borrowed luck roll, you can expend it and replace any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw made by you or a creature that you can see with the value of the borrowed luck roll. You can only have one borrowed luck roll at a time, and you lose any unused borrowed luck rolls when you complete a short or long rest.

When you hit a creature with an at-will tech power that requires an attack roll, you may treat that attack roll as a weapon attack for the purpose of using maneuvers.

#### Sleeper Program
_**Prerequisite:** Slicer Pursuit_<br>
Whenever you cast a tech power with a casting time of 1 action, you can choose to delay the power's activation up to a minute. When you do so, you cast the power as normal, but holds its energy for the duration of the delay. Holding onto the power's effect requires concentration. If your concentration is broken before the delay ends, the power dissipates without taking effect. You can use your reaction to activate the power at any time.

You can use this maneuver before or after making the ability check, but before the results of the ability check are determined.

### Vicious Hunting
Beginning at 6th level, your beast companion's strikes count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage. 

### Creature Comprehension
Starting at 9th level, when your beast makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you may expend a superiority die and apply the benefits of a maneuver you know from this class, as if you have taken the action yourself.

### Feral Ferocity
Once you've reached 17th level, you have learned how to push your beast beyond its limits. If your beast is within 30 feet of you and can see or hear you, you can command it to enter a furious state. While raging, your beast gains the following benefits:

## Bulwark Technique
Some scouts find themselves far from civilization not to hunt, gather intelligence, or escape danger, but to venture forth simply to defend those unable to defend themselves. Followers of the Bulwark Technique make use of advanced technology to contain those that threaten the undeserving.

### Bonus Proficiencies
You gain proficiency in heavy armor.

### Personal Barrier
When you choose this technique at 3rd level, you gain access to a powerful personal barrier. Whenever you complete a short or long rest, you create a barrier on yourself that lasts until you finish a short or long rest. That barrier has hit points equal to twice your scout level + your Intelligence modifier. Your barrier can never have hit points greater than twice your scout level + your Intelligence modifier.

Whenever you take damage, the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

While the barrier has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its power remains. Whenever you cast a tech power of 1st level or higher, your barrier regains hit points equal to the number of tech points spent.

Additionally, for as long as your barrier has hit points, you gain the following benefits:
- You are considered proficient in Constitution saving throws for the purpose of maintaining concentration on tech powers.
- Hostile creatures that hit you with melee attacks take energy damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

### Mark of the Bulwark

If the attack hits, and your Personal Barrier has hit points, the attacking creatures takes bonus damage equal to your Ranger's Quarry Damage Die.

### Projected Barrier
Beginning at 7th level, you've learned how to manipulate your barrier to create new effects. As an action, you can spend three of your barrier's hit points to create a unique effect. You have three such effects: Projected Sphere, Projected Maelstrom, and Projected Wave. When you use your Projected Barrier, you choose which effect to create.

Some Projected Barrier Effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.

If your barrier's hit points are reduced to 0, any Projected Barrier features immediately end.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

#### Projected Sphere
You create a protective spherical barrier barrier in a 5-foot-radius sphere a point you can see within 30 feet that lasts until the start of your next turn. Creatures within the barrier have three-quarters cover from attacks originating from outside the barrier. You can maintain the barrier by spending an additional barrier hit point at the start of each of your turns (no action required).

#### Projected Maelstrom
You create an unstable energy maelstrom in a 5-foot cube at a point you can see within 30 feet that lasts until the start of your next turn. A creature takes 4d4 energy damage when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. You can maintain the barrier by spending an additional barrier hit point at the start of each of your turns (no action required). 

This feature's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 11th level (5d4) and 17th level (6d4).

#### Projected Wave
You create a wave of barrier energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 energy damage and is pushed back to the edge of the cone. On a success, they take half damage and<br> aren't pushed.

This feature's damage increases by 1d6<br> when you reach 11th level (3d6) and 17th<br> level (4d6).

### Regenerative Shielding
Starting at 11th level, when a hostile<br> creature forces you to make a saving<br> throw and you succeed, your personal<br> barrier regains hit points equal<br> to your Intelligence modifier.

### Adaptive Barrier
At 15th level, when your personal<br> barrier takes damage, you can have it<br> gain resistance to subsequent damage<br> of that type until the start of your<br> next turn (no action required).<br> If it takes damage of more<br> than one type simultaneously,<br> you can choose which type it<br> gains resistance to. Your<br> barrier can only have<br> resistance to one type of<br> damage at a time.

## Illusionist Technique
Among the galaxy you may find the various infiltrators and agents who make ample use of holographic technology to get themselves in and out of danger. Followers of the Illusionist Technique make use of this holographic technology to give themselves an illusory edge in combat.

### Holographic Decoy
When you choose this technique at 3rd level, as an action, you can create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 10 minutes, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a power). The decoy appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. The decoy is purely visual. If anything passes through it, it is revealed to be an illusion. For the duration, you can cast tech powers as though you were in the decoy's space. Both your decoy and the target of your tech power must be within your line of sight.

You can use your bonus action to cause the decoy to move up to 30 feet. As your decoy changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the decoy. If your decoy is ever more than 120 feet away from you, it immediately disappears.

Additionally, when both you and your decoy are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the decoy, but is not aware it is an illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature.

A creature that uses its action to examine your decoy can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what<br> it is, the creature can see through the image.

Once you've used this feature, you must<br> complete a short or long rest before you<br> &emsp;can use it again. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Mark of the Illusionist
Also at 3rd level, the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature has disadvantage on all checks made to discern the nature of your illusions. Additionally, when the target of your Ranger's Quarry is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to immediately cause an active illusion, or your Holographic Decoy, to take the form of the creature as long as the creature's dimensions fall within the power's capacity restrictions.

### Charged Illusions
Beginning at 7th level, when a creature discerns the nature of an illusion you have created using a tech power or class feature while within 5 feet of it, you can dispel the illusion (no action required) to have the creature take energy damage equal to 1d10 + half your scout level (rounded down). 

### Quick Escape

- Whenever the creature casts a force power, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC to maintain concentration. On a failed save, the casting is disrupted, the force power fails, and the force points are wasted.
- Whenever the creature starts its turn while concentrating on a force power, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your force save DC to maintain concentration. On a failed save, it loses concentration on the power.

The damage is of the same type as the weapon's damage.

### Supernatural Defense

### Mystical Connection
Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you learn the *feedback* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and the target fails its saving throw.

- Your spirit can not interact with the corporeal world, but it is also not impeded by unenhanced walls or barriers.
- Your spirit acts independently of you, and it only obeys your commands if it chooses to. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. Your spirit can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
- While your spirit is within 100 feet of you, you can telepathically communicate with it. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your spirit's vision and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.
- When you cast a force power with a range of touch, your spirit can deliver the power as if it had cast it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the power when you cast it. If the power requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

You can only attune to one spirit at a time. If you attempt to attune to another spirit, you immediately break the bond with your current spirit.

> #### Generating Your Spirit
> Your spirit might be the ghost of a benevolent Jedi, discovered in the ruins of a Jedi temple, or a powerful Sith spirit lingering in an ancient artifact. It might be the spirit of a Nightsister sorceress, or a paragon of a long-forgotten monastic order. Work with your GM to determine the nature of your spirit.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

&emsp;Additionally, your spirit can briefly interact with the physical world. When you would make a melee attack, your spirit can deliver the attack as if it had made it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the attack. It uses your modifiers for the attack and damage rolls. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

### Invasive Presence
At 7th level, your spirit can invade another creature's being. As an action, your spirit can touch a creature within 5 feet of it, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw. 

On a failed save, your spirit moves into that creatures space, inhabiting its body, for 1 minute. The affected creature has disadvantage on the first attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes each turn. At the end of each its turns, the creature repeats this save. On a success, it repels the spirit from its body, and it becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

### Ethereal Vision
By 13th level, you and your guiding spirit both gain truesight out to 60 feet as long as your spirit is within 100 feet of you.

Additionally, when you use your action to see through your spirit's senses, you are no longer deaf and blind with regard to your own senses, able to comprehend what happens in both perspectives simultaneously.

### Assuming Direct Control
At 18th level, when a creature fails its saving throw against your Invasive Presence feature, the target becomes charmed by you for as long as Invasive Presence is active.

While the target is charmed, you and your spirit have a telepathic link with it as long as you are within 100 feet of it. You and your spirit can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

## Path of the Corsair
There may come a time when a sentinel finds themselves stranded, hunted, or in any situation where they must hide their nature as a force wielder. Those sentinels who follow the Path of the Corsair make use of alternative weaponry not commonly associated with force-wielders to great effect.

### Scavenger's Reach
Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you learn the *force disarm* force power. Additionally, you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and the target fails its save.

### Corsair Weapons
Also at 3rd level, you can use the force to quickly learn the use of unfamiliar weapons. When you hold a weapon that you are not proficient in, you can spend 1 force point (no action required) to gain proficiency with that weapon until the end of your next long rest. Additionally, you can use your Force-Empowered Self options when you hit with a ranged weapon attack.

Lastly, when you throw a grenade, you can use Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength when determining your throwing range.

### Force-Empowered Detonators
At 7th level, you learn to infuse a number of small detonators with the Force. Over the course of a short or long rest, you can create a number of detonators equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). Your detonators can only be used by you, and they lose their potency at the end of your next short or long rest.

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can throw one of your detonators at a point within range. Your detonators have a range equal to 30 feet + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier x 5. Make a universal ranged force attack. On a hit, the detonator adheres to the target, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is pushed back 5 feet. On a miss, it falls to the ground. Hit or miss, the detonator then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw against your universal force save DC. If the detonator adhered to a target, the creature has disadvantage on the saving throw. A creature takes force damage using your Kinetic Combat die + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Energized Kinetics
By 13th level, once per turn, when you deal damage with a Force-Empowered Detonator or your Double Strike feature, you can deal additional damage using your Kinetic Combat die. The damage type is force, lightning, necrotic, or psychic (your choice).

## Path of Etherealness
In the distant reaches of the galaxy obscure knowledge and forgotten secrets of the Force can sometimes be found. While other Force-sensitive may find themselves touched by this secret knowledge of the Force, those sentinels who follow the Path of Etherealness instead find themselves grabbed. Held onto by mysterious aspects of the Force that refuse to let go, these sentinels find themselves able to manipulate the universe around them.

### Aberrant Resilience
Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you learn the *resistance* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use your Deflection and Slow Time Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action. Finally, this power no longer requires concentration for you when you target yourself with it, and the power's d4 increases to d6 at 5th level, d8 at 11th level, and d10 at 17th level.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Force-Empowered Kinesis
Also at 3rd level, your connection to the Force allows you to briefly become incorporeal. When you use a Force-Empowered Self feature, until the end of your turn, you can move through other creatures and objects as if they are difficult terrain. If you end this movement inside a solid object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved. This damage can't be reduced or negated in any way.

### Out of Touch
At 7th level, as an action, you can step out of sync with the rest of the universe for 1 minute. At the start of each of your turns, roll a d20. If you roll 11 or higher, you and everything your are wearing or carrying are completely invisible to all beings, except for those with truesight. On a roll of 10 or lower, you instead appear as an indistinguishably blurred form roughly your normal height and weight, though a being with truesight sees you normally. Regardless of your appearance, for the duration, your speed doubles, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you can move through creatures and objects willingly though you can not affect them and they can not affect you. You can end this feature early on your turn (no action required). When this effect ends, if you are inside a solid object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved. 

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Event Cascade
By 13th level, you have advantage on attack rolls you make against creatures if you haven't dealt damage to them or affected them with a force power since the start of your previous turn.

### Aberrant Self
At 18th level, you no longer suffer the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged abnormally. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water, and you no longer need to sleep.

### Phasethrow
Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you learn the *saber throw* force power. Additionally, you no longer have disadvantage on the attack roll with it if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, and you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and hit a target. Finally, once per turn, when you hit a creature within 30 feet of you with the *saber throw* force power, you can spend 1 force point to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature.

### Forceblade Bond
Also at 3rd level, you learn how to bond with a lightweapon or vibroweapon through the Force, making it part of you.

You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond, gaining the following benefits:
- You can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. 
- If the weapon is within 60 feet<br> of you and you can see it, you<br> can summon that weapon as a<br> bonus action on your turn, causing it to travel instantly to you. If you have a free hand, you catch the weapon. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.
- You can use Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls.

You can have two weapons bonded to you in this way at a time, and you can summon both of them to you with the same bonus action.

### Twin Saber Throw
At 7th level, when you cast *saber throw*<br> while wielding your forceblade, you<br> add half your forcecasting ability<br> modifier (rounded down) to the<br> damage rolls, and you can att-<br>ack the same target multiple<br> times. Additionally, when<br> you make your Kinetic Combat attack, if you spent<br> a force point to teleport to within 5 feet of the<br> target, you make the attack roll with<br> advantage.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Disruptive Throw
By 13th level, when you are the target of a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to throw your forceblade at the source of the attack. Make a ranged force attack. On a hit, this attack deals damage using your Kinetic Combat die and you impose disadvantage on the triggering attack roll.

## Path of Synthesis
There is power in diversity unknown to those of narrow mind. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Synthesis blend their intricate mastery of the Force with their understanding of technology, creating unique effects to overcome their obstacles.

### Techcasting Secrets
Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you have learned to intersperse your training with an aptitude for technology. Choose two tech powers of 1st-level or lower. The chosen powers count as universal force powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the sentinel table. You still require the aid of a wristpad for these powers.

At 7th-level, you learn two tech powers of 2nd-level or lower. At 13th level, you learn two tech powers of 3rd-level or lower. At 17th level, you learn two tech powers of 4th-level or lower. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tech powers you know and replace it with another tech power of no higher than the level determined by this feature.

### Synthetic Understanding
Also at 3rd level, you've applied your newfound knowledge to broader pursuits. You gain proficiency in Technology or one tool of your choice.

Additionally, when you make an Intelligence (Technology) check, or a check with a tool, you may use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) instead of your Intelligence modifier.

Finally, when you deal damage with a tech power or your Deflection Force Empowered Self option, you can choose to substitute the damage dealt as ion.

### Force-Empowered Tech
At 7th level, you learn to fully blend your technological aptitude with your use of the Force. You have three such effects: Disruption Pulse, Force Override, and Techcasting Insight. When you use your Force-Empowered Tech, you choose which effect to create.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Disruption Pulse
As an action, you can send out a 30 foot cone of electromagnetically-charged energy to overload enemy weapons. Each creature within the cone that is wearing or carrying a weapon with electric components must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the weapon is being worn, this save is made with disadvantage. On a failed save, the first attack they attempt to make with that weapon has disadvantage. A creature with multiple weapons must make a separate save for each weapon.

#### Forced Override
When you cast a tech power that requires a saving throw, you can impose disadvantage on the save (no action required).

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

#### Techcasting Insight
As an action, you can attempt to determine another creature's experience with techcasting. When you do so, you make an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Technology) check. If you succeed, you immediately learn the target's techcasting Max Power Level, as well as any tech powers currently affecting the target.

### Improved Force-Empowered Tech
By 13th level, you've gained access to two additional Force-Empowered Tech effects: Harmonic Synthesis and Conservation of Energy.

#### Harmonic Synthesis
When you use your action to cast a force power, you can use your bonus action to gain resistance to damage dealt by tech powers until the start of your next turn. If you use your action to cast a tech power, you can instead gain resistance to damage dealt by force powers.

#### Conservation of Energy
When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a tech power, you can reduce the force point cost of the tech power to 0 (no action required).

### Reflective Shield
At 18th level, when you use your Force-Empowered Tech features, a barrier for energy shimmers into existence, surrounding you until the end of your next turn. When you take damage, you can mitigate the incoming energy and potentially reflect it back at your attacker. You use your reaction to have resistance against the triggering damage, and if the<br> source of the damage is within 5<br> feet of you, they take half of<br> the total damage dealt<br> as ion.

Also at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect a strike when you are hit by a melee weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your 

<div style='margin-top:35px'></div>

sentinel level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can redirect it at another target if you have a weapon capable of doing so. You can spend 1 force point to make a melee weapon attack at a target within 5 feet of you with the weapon, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and if the attack hits it uses your Kinetic Combat die for its damage roll. If *saber ward* is active, you have advantage on the attack roll.

### Kinetic Bulwark
At 7th level, you can extend your Kinetic Ward to a creature within 5 feet of you when they are hit by a melee weapon attack. If this damage is not reduced to 0, the warded creature takes any remaining damage. 

### Indomitable
By 13th level, the Force flowing through you makes it harder for movement to be forced upon you. You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to avoid being grappled or moved. If you fail the saving throw or ability check, you can spend 1 force point to reroll one of the dice once. You must use the new roll.

Additionally, if allies within 5 feet of you are gaining the benefit of your *saber ward* force power, they also gain the benefit of this feature.

### Kinetic Bastion
At 18th level, you can protect allies even further from you. When a creature within 30 feet of you is hit by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to teleport to them and extend your Kinetic Ward. If this damage is not reduced to 0, the warded creature takes any remaining damage. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Path of Witchcraft
The Force connects all living things. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Witchcraft use that connection to summon the aid of nature, both beasts and the elements, adapting them to their will.

### Wild Power
Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you learn the *enfeeble* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and the target fails its save. Finally, you add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to damage rolls with it.

### Beast Companion
Also at 3rd level, you learn to create a powerful bond through the Force with your own personal beast companion.

Choose your beast, which is detailed at the end of this calling. Over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of herbs and food to call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your companion. 

If your beast dies, or you want to bond with a different creature, you must first break the bond with your current beast companion. You may only have one beast companion at a time.

Your beast gains a variety of benefits while it is bonded to you:
- The beast obeys your commands as best it can. It acts on your turn, and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your beast acts on its own.
- Your beast's level equals your sentinel level, and for each sentinel level you gain after 3rd, your beast companion gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly.
- Your beast has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level.
- Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature in this class, your beast's abilities also improve. Your beast can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your beast can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.

Additionally, while your beast companion is within 5 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:
- When you use your Kinetic Combat or Force-Empowered Self features to increase your speed or armor class, you can instead grant this bonus to your beast companion. 
- You and your beast companion can communicate telepathically, though your beast companion can only communicate in and understand simple concepts.

This radius increases to 10 feet at 7th level, 20 feet at 13th level, and 30 feet at 18th level.

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Nature's Vigor
At 7th level, you've learned to attune your senses with nature. If you spend at least 1 minute meditating while in nature, you gain the following benefits for 1 hour:
- You ignore difficult terrain caused by nature.
- You can understand plants within 30 feet of you. They can telepathically communicate simple ideas to you, including memories from within the past day.
- You can command plants within 30 feet of you to create difficult terrain, or other tasks at the GM's discretion (no action required).

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Beastwarden
By 13th level, your bond with your beast companion strengthens, granting the following benefits while your beast companion is within 20 feet of you:
- When you cast a force power that targets only yourself, and your beast companion is within range, you can also target your beast companion with that power. 
- If you have darkvision and your beast doesn't, your beast gains it with the same radius. If your beast has darkvision and you don't, you gain it with the same radius. If you both have darkvision, you both use the larger radius, which then increases by 30 feet.
- If you have advantage on Perception checks and your beast doesn't, your beast gains advantage on Perception checks. If your beast has advantage on Perception checks and you don't, you gain advantage on Perception checks. If you both have advantage on Perception checks, when either of you makes a Perception check with advantage, you can reroll one of the dice once.

This radius increases to 30 feet at 18th level.

### Stormcaller
At 18th level, you've learned to command the elements to summon a fierce storm in a 30-foot radius around you. As an action, you can gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
- You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.
- You have resistance to energy, lightning, and necrotic damage.
- Whenever a hostile creature enters this radius or starts its turn there, it takes 10 lightning damage.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Generating Your Beast 
Choosing your beast companion is an integral part of being a Witchcraft Sentinel. Your beast takes a form of your choosing. Alternatively, your GM can choose what form your beast takes based on your environment. 

Once you've selected your type of beast, you assign your beast companion's ability scores. Your beast's Intelligence score is 6, and you assign its other ability scores using a limited standard array (16, 14, 14, 12, 10) as you see fit.
