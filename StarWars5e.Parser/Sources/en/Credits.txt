___

First and foremost, I have to thank the person who got me into D&D: my buddy, Ross. That playgroup was not great, but it started my journey.

Second, I have to thank the original guinea pigs of this conversion: Drew, Eric, and Rickey. It was comically bad, but we had fun with it.

Lastly, while I would love to say that I created *everything* in this conversion, that wouldn't be *entirely* true. The following people deserve credit as well:

### The SW5e Jedi Council
Aeryn for the awesome new podcast (with<br> &emsp;toddmoonbounce, of course)<br>
Bob the Builder for his work on strongholds and feats<br>
DarkMesa for writing almost as many archetypes as I<br> &emsp;have at this point<br>
DrakeRyzer for his work on polishing factions and ships<br>
