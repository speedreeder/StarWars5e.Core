&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">ix abilities provide a quick description of</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every creature's physical and mental<br> characteristics:<br>

- **Strength**, measuring physical power
- **Dexterity**, measuring agility

- **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory
- **Wisdom**, measuring awareness and intuition
- **Charisma**, measuring force of personality

___

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities—a creature's assets as well as weaknesses.

The three main rolls of the game—the ability check, the attack roll, and the saving throw—rely on the six ability scores. The book's introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.

This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks and saving throws, covering the fundamental activities that creatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls appear in chapter 9.

## Ability Scores and Modifiers
Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and villains can have scores as high as 30.

Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.

To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).

Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.

## Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes a special ability or power tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

|28-29|+9|

</div>

&emsp;If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

When you make a roll with advantage or disadvantage, only the d20 is rolled twice. Any additional dice, such as the d4 granted by the *resistance* force power, are only rolled once.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the iktotchi's Precognition trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if an iktotchi has advantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the iktotchi could use the Precognition trait to reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or powers. Inspiration (see chapter 4) can also give a character advantage on checks related to the character's personality, ideals, or bonds. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.

### Advantage on Other Rolls
Though less common, advantage and disadvantage can occur on other types of rolls as well. When you have advantage or disadvantage on a roll, as with a d20, you roll the dice twice, using the higher of the two results with advantage, and using the lower of the two results if you have disadvantage. If a roll has multiple dice, you roll the dice together and treat the results separately.

For instance, the second bullet of the Weapon Expert feat grants conditional advantage on a weapon's damage roll once per turn, provided you meet the criteria for that advantage. If any additional dice would be added to the damage roll, such as the operative's Sneak Attack feature or the scout's Ranger's Quarry, those additional dice are only rolled once.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 7 | USING ABILITY SCORES</div>

\pagebreakNum

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

&emsp;If granting advantage or disadvantage on a roll that would have negative consequences rather than positive benefits, advantage and disadvantage should be reversed (as logic dictates). For instance, if a creature has a penalty die on a d20 roll, such as a d4 penalty die from the *denounce* force power, and they get disadvantage on that die roll, they should roll the d4 twice and take the higher roll, instead of the lower.

## Minimum Roll Threshold
Certain features, such as the Great Weapon fighting style, add a minimum roll threshold, which means your dice can no longer roll below a certain amount, instead treating the die's result as the threshold. This threshold varies depending on the die size: 2 for d4, 2 for d6, 3 for d8, 4 for d10, 5 for d12, and 8 for d20.

For instance, a character with the Great Weapon fight style wielding a two-handed weapon that deals 1d12 rolls a 3 on a damage die, they treat the result as if they'd rolled a 5.

## Proficiency Bonus
Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, as detailed in chapter 1. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.

Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.

Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved. for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.

By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn't normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don't add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the Lore skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (Lore) checks.

In general, you don't multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.

### Expertise
Certain features, such as the Expertise class feature or Ace Pilot feat, grant expertise in a skill or tool, letting you double your proficiency bonus with that skill or tool. As usual, you can only gain expertise in a skill or tool once.

Far less common, though still possible, a creature can gain expertise in a saving throw. Creatures cannot gain expertise in weapons, however.

\columnbreak

## Ability Checks
An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by Difficulty Class (DC). The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Ability Check DCs table shows common DCs.

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.

### Contests
Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.

##### Ability Check DCs
|Task Difficulty|	DC|
|:--|:--:|
|Very easy| 5|
|Easy|	10|
|Medium|	15|
|Hard	|20|
|Very hard	|25|
|Nearly impossible|	30|

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 7 | USING ABILITY SCORES</div>

### Additional Dice
When making an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, some features grant an additional die when you make the d20 roll. If features would grant multiple additional dice in such a way, you can only benefit from one of them when you make the d20 roll (you choose which effect to use). For instance, if a creature is forced to make a saving throw, and it is benefiting from both a Potent Aptitude die and the *resistance* force power, it can only use the additional die granted by one of those effects. Conversely, the same is true for penalty dice.

#### Variant: Additional Die Teamwork
In some instances, a party might be relying on the outcome made by a single party member's ability check. If multiple party members could grant that character an additional die, while that character couldn't apply multiple dice to the roll, you might consider allowing them to use the larger die provided, and to roll the die with advantage.

### Multiple Modifiers
As with additional dice, when making an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, some features might allow multiple modifiers being added to the roll. In these cases, only two modifiers may be added to a roll, and the same modifier can't be added twice unless an effect says so. For instance, if a friendly creature makes a Constitution saving throw within range of a guardian's Aura of Presence, and that creature is also the target of a scholar's Critical Analysis, and they chose to end that Critical Analysis on themselves, they could add either that guardian's Wisdom modifier or the scholar's Intelligence modifier to their Constitution save, but not both.

> #### Applying During the d20 Roll
> Some features, such as engineer's Potent Aptitude or scholar's Critical Analysis, allow a creature to choose to add an additional die or ability modifier to an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Unless the effect specifically says otherwise, it can be applied before or after the roll, but it must be applied before the GM determines whether the roll succeeds or fails.

### Skills
Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect.

The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability's description in the later sections of this chapter for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.

- **Strength**: Athletics
- **Dexterity**: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth
- **Intelligence**: Investigation, Lore, Nature, Piloting, Technology
- **Wisdom**: Animal handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, Survival

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

- **Charisma**: Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion

Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill—for example, "Make a Wisdom (Perception) check." At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.

For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff. the Dungeon Master might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.

#### Variant: Skills with Other Abilities
Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. 

So if you're proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your trandoshan berserker uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.

### Passive Checks
A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.

Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:

10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check. If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score.

For example. if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.

The rules on hiding in the "Dexterity" section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules in chapter 8.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 7 | USING ABILITY SCORES</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Working Together
Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort, or the one with the highest ability modifier, can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action (see chapter 9).

A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with security kits, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task. Moreover. a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.

#### Group Checks
When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something together, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at the task at hand help cover those who aren't. To make a group ability check,  everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.

Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.

## Using Each Ability
Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.

### Strength
Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

#### Strength Checks
A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.

***Athletics.*** Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:

- You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.
- You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.
- You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

&emsp;***Other Strength Checks.*** The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
- Break free of bonds
- Push through a tunnel that is too small
- Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it
- Tip over a statue
- Keep a boulder from rolling

#### Attack Rolls and Damage
You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a vibrosword or doublesword. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand—to—hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.

#### Lifting and Carrying
Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.

***Carrying Capacity.*** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.

***Push, Drag, or Lift.*** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.

***Size and Strength.*** Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature' carrying capacity and the amount it can push. drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.

#### Arm Equipment 
Certain equipment, such as a wristpad, light shield, or fixed weapons, are worn on the forearm. A creature can only wield a number of such items on each forearm equal to half its Strength modifier (minimum of one item).

#### Variant: Encumberance
The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table in chapter 5.

If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are ***encumbered***, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.

If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead ***heavily encumbered***, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

\pagebreakNum

### Dexterity
Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.

#### Dexterity Checks
A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.

***Acrobatics.*** Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking spaceship's deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

***Sleight of Hand.*** Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a wallet off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.

***Stealth.*** Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

***Other Dexterity Checks.*** The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
- Steer a chariot around a tight turn
- Pick a lock
- Disable a trap
- Securely tie up a prisoner
- Wriggle free of bonds
- Play a stringed instrument
- Craft a small or detailed object

#### Attack Rolls and Damage
You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon. such as a blaster rifle or bowcaster. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a vibrodagger or techblade.

#### Armor Class
Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, as described in chapter 5.

#### Initiative
At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in combat, as described in<br> &emsp;chapter 9.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

> ##### Hiding
>When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that checks total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.
> 
> You can't hide from a creature that can see you, and if you make noise (such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase), you give away your position. An invisible creature can't be seen, so it can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, however, and it still has to stay quiet.
> 
> In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the Dungeon Master might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack before you are seen.
> 
> ***Passive Perception.*** When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.
> 
> For example, if a lst-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.
> 
> ***What Can You See?*** One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be **lightly** or **heavily** obscured, as explained in chapter 8.

### Constitution
Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.

#### Constitution Checks
Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks. because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.

The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Hold your breath
- March or labor for hours without rest
- Go without sleep
- Survive without food or water
- Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go

#### Hit Points
Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.

If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you're 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.

\columnbreak

### Intelligence
Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.

#### Intelligence Checks
An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Investigation, Lore, Nature, Piloting, and Technology skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.

***Investigation.*** When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient materials in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

***Lore.*** Your Intelligence (Lore) check measures your ability to recall information about the Force, artifacts, histories, and religions.

***Nature.*** Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.

***Piloting.*** Your Intelligence (Piloting) check measures your ability to control vehicles, aircraft, and spaceships. Piloting governs your ability to maneuver through tight spaces and debris fields or dogfight with enemy craft. 

***Technology.*** Your Intelligence (Technology) checks measure your ability to recall information about droids, vehicles, spaceships, aircraft, and computers, as well as your ability to interface with them. Technology can also be used to stabilize a droid or construct.

***Other Intelligence Checks.*** The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Communicate with a creature without using words
- Estimate the value of a precious item
- Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard
- Forge a document
- Recall lore about a craft or trade
- Win a game of skill

#### Techcasting Ability
Techcasters use Intelligence as their techcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of power they cast.

### Wisdom
Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.

#### Wisdom Checks
A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone's feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.

***Animal Handling.*** When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal's intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.

***Insight.*** Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

***Medicine.*** A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.

***Perception.*** Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.

***Survival.*** The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that rancors live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.

***Other Wisdom Checks.*** The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
- Discern Whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead

#### Forcecasting Ability
Forcecasters use Wisdom as their forcecasting ability for their light side and universal powers, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of powers they cast.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

> ##### Finding a Hidden Object
> When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the GM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.
> 
> In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the GM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer ofa bureau. If you tell the GM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.

### Charisma
Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.

#### Charisma Checks
A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.

***Deception.*** Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

***Intimidation.*** When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

***Performance.*** Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance. acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

***Persuasion.*** When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a Chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

***Other Charisma Checks.*** The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
- Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation

#### Forcecasting Ability
Forcecasters use Charisma as their forcecasting ability for their dark side and universal powers, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of powers they cast.

## Saving Throws
A saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist a power, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don't normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.

A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The operative, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a power is determined by the caster's force- or tech-casting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.
