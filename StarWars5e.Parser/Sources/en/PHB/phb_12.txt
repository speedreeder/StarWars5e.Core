<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 12 | TECH POWERS</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Absorb Energy
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you take acid, cold, energy, fire, ion, kinetic, lightning, or sonic damage
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 round

The power captures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on you and storing it for your next melee attack. You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type, and the power ends.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a power slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Acid Dart
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 

A shimmering green dart streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged tech attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the dart splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Acid Splash
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You emit a burst of acid. Choose one creature within range that you can see, or choose two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other that you can see. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage.

This power's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

#### Acid Wind
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot cube)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You produce a breeze full of stinging acid droplets. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d4 acid damage and is blinded until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:16px'></div>

&emsp;***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Acidic Strike
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Varies
- **Duration:** 1 round

As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within your reach, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes sheathed in a thick acidic slime until the start of your next turn. Until the start of your next turn, if the target becomes grappled, or succeeds in grappling or maintaining a grapple, the slime is pressed into its body, causing it to immediately take 1d8 acid damage. 

This power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 acid damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for taking grappling or maintaining a grapple increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.

#### Alarm
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** 8 hours, or until the end of your next short or long rest; whichever happens first

You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the power ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the power, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible. 

A silent alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.

#### Analyze
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the power. If it is an enhanced or modified item, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any powers are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a power, you learn which power created it.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what tech powers, if any, are currently affecting it.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 12 | TECH POWERS</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Antipathy/Sympathy
_8th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 60 feet 
- **Duration:** 10 days

This power attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as rancors, kath hounds, or twi'leks. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.

***Antipathy.*** The power causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.

***Sympathy.*** The power causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the target. 

If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

***Ending the Effect.*** If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as unnatural. In addition, a creature affected by the power is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the power persists.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.

#### Assess the Situation
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 round

You take a sensory snapshot of a target within range. Your tech grants you a brief insight into the target's defenses. You have advantage on the next attack roll you make against the target before the end of your next turn.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:16px'></div>

&emsp;This power benefits additional attacks at higher levels: two attacks at 5th level, three attacks at 11th level, and four attacks at 17th level.

#### Autonomous Servant
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** 8 hours, or until the end of your next short or long rest; whichever happens first

You touch one Tiny, unenhanced object that isn't attached to another object or a surface and isn't being carried by another creature. The target animates and gains little arms and legs, becoming a creature under your control until the power ends or the creature drops to 0 hit points. See the stat block for its statistics. 

___
> ## Servant
>*Tiny construct, unaligned*
> ___
> - **Armor Class** 15 (natural armor)
> - **Hit Points** 10 (4d4)
> - **Speed** 30 feet, climb 30 feet

> - **Condition Immunities** charmed, deafened, exhaustion, poisoned
> - **Senses** blindsight 60 feet (blind beyond this radius), passive Perception 10
> - **Languages** —
> ___
> **Circuitry.** The construct has disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deal ion or lightning damage.
> ### Actions
> ***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 feet, one target. *Hit* 5 (1d4 + 3) kinetic damage.

As a bonus action, you can nonverbally command the creature if it is within 120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures with this power, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a simple, general command, such as to fetch a code cylinder, stand watch, or stack some small objects. If you issue no commands, the servant does nothing other than defend itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the servant continues to follow that order until its task is complete.

When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.

The creature is considered a valid target for the *tracker droid interface* power.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 12 | TECH POWERS</div>

\pagebreakNum

<div style='margin-top:16px'></div>

&emsp;***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Bacta Pack
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You create a luminescent pack of bacta in any space, occupied or unoccupied, within range. The pack remains in its space until it is activated by any creature you choose. If the space you choose is occupied by a creature you have designated, it can use its reaction to immediately activate the pack; otherwise, a creature within 5 feet of the pack can use a bonus action to touch it and activate it.

When the pack is activated by a designated creature, that creature regains hit points equal to 1d6 + your techcasting ability modifier, and the pack is consumed. If the power ends before the pack has been activated, it becomes useless and disintegrates. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, you may either increase the healing of a single pack by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st, or create another pack in a separate space, with one additional pack for each slot level above 1st.

#### Ballistic Shield
_4th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A flickering blue shield surrounds your body. Until the power ends, you have resistance to kinetic, energy, and ion damage.

#### Bestow Virus
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a droid, construct, or a creature with a tech focus, and it must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or receive a tech-based curse for the duration of the power. When you cast this power, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:
- Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.
- While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
- While cursed, the target must make an Intelligence saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.
- While the target is cursed, your attacks and powers deal an extra 1d8 lightning damage to the target.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:16px'></div>

&emsp;A *remove virus* power ends this effect. At the GM's discretion, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The GM has final say on such a curse's effect.

**Overcharge Tech.** If you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a tech slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a tech slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th-level tech slot, the power lasts until it is dispelled. Using a tech slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn't require concentration.

#### Buffer
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You gain 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points for the duration. 

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, you gain 5 additional temporary hit points for each slot level above 1st.

#### Cage
_7th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Duration:** 1 hour

An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of energy springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box as you choose.

A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any powers cast into or out of the area.

When you cast the power, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.

A creature inside the cage can't leave it by unenhanced means. If the creature tries to teleport to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that power to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the power or effect. 

This power can't be dispelled.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 12 | TECH POWERS</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Capacity Boost
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You empower a blaster weapon you are holding. For the duration, you can reload the weapon once on each of your turns without using an action, and as a bonus action on each of your turns you can make one attack with the weapon.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 5th level or higher, you can make two attacks with your bonus action, instead of one.

#### Carbon Fog
_6th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a cloud of icy fog in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see. The sphere extends around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The fog is semi-solid, and its area is considered difficult terrain. Each creature that enters the power's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 4d6 cold damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of its turn. The fog lasts for the duration of the power or until it's dispersed by a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 mph).

#### Carbonite
_6th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to freeze one creature that you can see within range into carbonite. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn't affected. 

A creature restrained by this power must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this power three times, the power ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

If the creature is physically broken while frozen in carbonite, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.

If you maintain your concentration on this power for the entire possible duration, the creature is frozen in carbonite until the effect is removed.

#### Carbonite Explosion
_9th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 250 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You generate an explosion of cryogenic energy in a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:16px'></div>

within range. Each creature in the affected area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 + 20 cold damage and is restrained for 1 minute as it is encased in carbonite. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and is restrained until the end of its next turn. 

As an action, a restrained creature can make a Strength check against your tech save DC, ending this effect on itself on a success.

A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this power dies instantly, as its body shatters into frozen chunks.

#### Cloaking Screen
_4th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the power ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person.

#### Combustive Shot
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Varies
- **Duration:** 1 round

As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a ranged weapon attack against one creature within your weapon's range, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes ignited (your techcasting ability modifier). 

This power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the ranged attack deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to the target, and the ignited damage increases to 1d4 + your tech casting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d6 and 1d4, respectively, at 11th level and 17th level.

#### Concealed Caltrops
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You scatter a large number of caltrops across ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range. These caltrops pierce deep into the feet and boots of anyone who walks upon them. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 kinetic damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The caltrops are nearly invisible to the naked eye. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the power is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your tech save DC to notice the caltrops before entering the area.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 12 | TECH POWERS</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Condense/Vaporize
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

In an open container, you can create up to 10 gallons of drinkable water. You may also produce a rain that falls within a 30-foot cube and extinguishes open-air flames. You can destroy the same amount of water in an open container, or destroy a 30-foot cube of fog. 

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the amount of water you can create increases by 10 gallons, or the size of the cube increases by 5 feet, for each slot level above 1st.

#### Contingency
_6th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 10 days

Choose a tech power of 5th-level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that power, called the contingent power, as part of casting contingency, expending tech points for both, but the contingent power doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two powers. 

The contingent power takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then contingency ends.

The contingent power takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one contingency power at a time. If you cast this power again, the effect of another contingency power on you ends. Also, contingency ends on you if your tech focus is ever not on your person.

#### Copy
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This power creates a perfect duplicate of any written, drawn, or digital visual, audio or text-based data that you touch onto a datapad or datacard you supply. You can copy up to 10 pages of text or 10 minutes of visual or audio data with one casting of this power. Enhanced documents, such as datacrons, blueprints, or encrypted documents, can't be copied with this power.

\columnbreak

#### Corrosive Sphere
_4th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a globule of acid and hurl it at a point within range, where it explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d4 acid damage and another 5d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Countermeasures
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

For the duration, you gain the following benefits:
- You are immune to the *homing rockets* tech power. 
- You and objects you are wearing or carrying cannot be detected by tech powers that reveal your location, such as *scan area* or *frequency scan*, unless the caster makes a successful Intelligence saving throw. 
- Creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track you.

#### Cryogenic Blast
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You release a shard of cryogenic energy at one creature within range. Make a ranged tech attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 kinetic damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 cold damage.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Cryogenic Burst
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 

You emit a burst of cold energy at a creature within range. Make a ranged tech attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn.

The power's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

#### Cryogenic Spray
_5th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 

A blast of cold air erupts from you. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d8 cold damage, and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't slowed.

A creature killed by this power becomes frozen in carbonite.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

#### Cryogenic Storm
_4th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet

A storm of cryogenic energy encompasses the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 kinetic damage and 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The storm's area of effect becomes difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 5th level or higher, the kinetic damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Cryogenic Suspension
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be affected by this power for the duration.

An affected target gains 1 slowed level, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.

If the creature attempts to cast a power with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the power doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the power. If it can't, the power is wasted.	

A creature affected by this power makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.

#### Cryogenic Volley
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

An explosion of cold energy erupts from a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 cold damage, and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't slowed.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Cryogenic Wave
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot cone)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of cold energy spreads out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 cold damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half as much damage, and suffers no additional effect.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st. At 3rd level or above, a creature gains 2 slowed levels on a failed save. At 5th level or above, a creature gains 3 slowed levels on a failed save. At 7th level or above, a creature gains 4 slowed levels on a failed save.

_4th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a creature that has died within the last minute and administer a shock to restore it to life. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This power can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the power automatically fails. Once this power has restored a creature to life, it cannot benefit from this power again until it finishes a short or long rest.

#### Delayed Explosion
_7th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You create a delayed explosion at a point within range. When the power ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the explosion occurs. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The power's base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the explosion has not yet occurred, the damage increases by 1d6.

If the explosion is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the power ends immediately, causing the explosion. 

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.

#### Destroy Tech

While the power is active, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks to find any traps that are within line of sight.

#### Diminish Tech
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 

Choose one creature, object, or tech effect within range. Any tech power of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each tech power of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your techcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the power's level. On a success, the power ends.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a tech power on the target if the power's level is equal to or less than the level of the tech slot you used.

#### Disintegrate
_6th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 

A blast of corrosive energy emits from you. Choose a target within range. 

A creature targeted by this power must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 acid damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.

A disintegrated creature and everything unenhanced it is wearing or carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized.

This power automatically disintegrates an unenhanced Large or smaller object. If the target is a Huge or larger object, this power disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it.

#### Electromesh
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 

You expel a mass of thick, adhesive mesh at a point of your choice within range. The mesh fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The mesh is difficult terrain and lightly obscures their area.

If the mesh isn't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the electromesh collapses on itself, and the power ends at the start of your next turn. Mesh layered over a flat surface has a depth of 5 feet.

Each creature that starts its turn in the mesh or that enters it during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the mesh or until it breaks free.

A creature restrained by the mesh can use its action to make a Strength check against your tech save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.

The mesh is flammable. Any 5-foot cube of electromesh exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

#### Electroshock
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Lightning springs from you to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee tech attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is made of metal or wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage and becomes shocked until the start of its next turn.

This power's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

#### Element of Surprise

_4th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose one creature you can see and one damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or sonic. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the first time on each turn when it takes damage of the chosen type, it takes an extra 2d6 damage of it. The target also loses resistance to the type until the power ends.

***Overcharge Tech.*** You can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

#### Encrypted Message
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** 1 round

You point your finger toward a creature within range that possesses a commlink and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can send an encrypted reply that only you can hear. These messages cannot be intercepted or decrypted by unenhanced means.

You can cast this power through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the power. The power doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

#### Energetic Burst
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

A creature you touch gains 10 temporary hit points. While it has these hit points, the creature can add 1d4 to its saving throws. Any remaining temporary hit points are lost when the power ends.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power with a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the target gains 5 additional temporary hit points for each slot level above 2nd. When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, the die size increases for every two slot levels above 2nd (d6 at 4th level, d8 at 6th level, d10 at 8th level).

#### Execute Command
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** 1 round

You dictate a one-word command to a droid or construct you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. If the construct has the 'Piloted' trait, and has a pilot controlling it that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot's Intelligence modifier. Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can't follow your command, the power ends.

***Approach.*** The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

***Deactivate.*** The target falls prone and then ends its turn.

***Drop.*** The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.

***Flee.*** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.

***Halt.*** The target doesn't move and takes no actions. A flying target stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional droid or construct for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

#### Expeditious Retreat

#### Explosion
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create an explosion at a point within range. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

\columnbreak

#### Extinguish
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet (5-foot cube)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You spray carbon foam in a 5-foot cube originating from a point within range. Flames within the affected area are instantly quenched, and objects within the affected area cannot be ignited for at least one minute. Any creature in the affected area must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 cold damage.

When you reach 5th level, this power can instead target a 10-foot cube within range. You gain additional options of increasing size when you reach 11th level (15-foot cube), and 17th level (20-foot cube).

#### Fabricate Trap
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered

When you cast this power, you create a trap that will later trigger in response to a certain condition. You must attach it either to a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed or turned on (such as a book, door, or computer terminal) to conceal the trap. The trap can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. At the GM's discretion, certain actions may cause the trap to break or be rendered inoperative.

The trap is well disguised, and generally and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC to be found.

You decide what triggers the trap when you cast the power, such as entering a certain area or powering on the object. You can further refine the trigger so the trap activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature kind (for example, the trap could be set to go off only droids or gungans). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the trap, such as those who say a certain password.

You may only have one instance of this trap active at a time. If you cast another trap before the previous one is triggered, the other trap becomes inert.

When you create the trap, choose an explosive trap or a power trap:

***Explosive Trap.*** When triggered, the trap erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the trap. The explosion spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or sonic damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the trap), or half as much damage on a successful one.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 12 | TECH POWERS</div>

\pagebreakNum

<div style='margin-top:16px'></div>

&emsp;***Power Trap.*** You can store a prepared tech power of 3rd level or lower in the trap by casting it as part of creating the trap. The trap must target a single creature or an area. The power being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the trap is triggered, the stored power is cast. If the trap has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the trap. If the power affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the power requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive trap increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a power trap, you can store any power of up to the same level as the slot you use for this power.

#### Find the Path
_6th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 day

This power calculates out the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same planet. If you name a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn't specific (such as "a Black Sun lair"), the power fails.

For the duration, as long as you are on the same planet as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies. While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to the destination.

#### Firestorm
_6th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose a point on the ground within range, incinerating everything in a 15-foot radius. All creatures must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d8 fire damage on a failure or half as much on a success. All large or smaller creatures are pushed to the edge of the power's radius. You may choose one creature to be at the very center of the firestorm, if you do so that creature has disadvantage on its saving throw and is knocked prone on a failure.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 and the radius increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 6th.

\columnbreak

#### Flame Sweep
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot cone)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A thin sheet of flames shoots forth from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Flaming Shots
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You channel tech power through a blaster weapon you are wielding. When a target takes damage from the chosen weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The power ends when twelve shots have been fired.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the number of shots you can take with this power increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Flash
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Duration:** 1 round

You create a massive flash of light and explosion of sound at a point within range. Roll 6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this power can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of the point are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this power is blinded until the end of your next turn. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 12 | TECH POWERS</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Frequency Scan
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you can detect electronic transmissions. When you cast the power and as your action on each turn until the power ends, you can focus on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose does not possess a commlink, or is not a droid or construct, the creature is unaffected.

If the creature possesses a commlink or other communications device, you receive any transmissions it broadcasts or receives for the duration.

Additionally, if the target is a droid or construct, you can read its "thoughts." You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), and something that looms large in its mind (such as its current objectives). If it succeeds, the power ends. Either way, the target (or its pilot, if it has one) knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the power ends.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this power is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

You can also use this power to detect the presence of droids, constructs, or creatures bearing communications devices you can't see. When you cast the power or as your action during the duration, you can search for transmissions within 30 feet of you. The power can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.

Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts or transmissions for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.

\columnbreak

#### Friendly Fire
_5th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You scramble the targeting protocols of nearby machines. Each droid or construct in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make an Intelligence saving throw. If a construct has the 'Piloted' trait, and has a pilot controlling it that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot's Intelligence modifier. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies until the power ends. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target, it must choose the target at random from among the creatures it can see within range of the attack, power, or other ability it’s using. If an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, the creature must make that attack if it is able to.

#### Gleaming Outline
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the power is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.

#### Glide
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 30 feet of you falls
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** 1 minute

One willing creature gains the ability to glide when falling. For the duration of the power, it falls at a rate of 30 feet per round and can move up to 30 feet horizontally as well on each of its turns. If the creature lands before the power ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the power ends for that creature.

#### Greater Analyze
_5th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Name or describe a person, place, or object. This power gives you a summary of significant lore about it. If the thing you named isn't known outside of one planetary system, you gain no information. The more information you already have, the more detailed the information you receive is.

#### Greater Explosion
_9th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 

You expell a massive explosion at a point within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 40d6 fire damage and is knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one but remain standing.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

#### Greater Hologram
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an image no larger than a 20 foot cube. It appears at a spot you can see and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, sounds and other sensory effects included. You can't create a sensory effect strong enough to cause damage or a condition.

As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to make the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter it so that its movements appear natural for the image.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it as an illusion. A creature can use its action to determine that it's an illusion with a successful Investigation check. If a creature learns it's an illusion, it can see through the image, and the other sensory qualities become faint to it.

***Overcharge Tech.*** The power lasts until dispelled without requiring concentration if cast at 6th-level or higher.

\columnbreak

#### Greater Light
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** 1 hour 

A 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads from a point you choose. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.

If you chose an object you are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the light shines from and moves with the object. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light.

If any of this power's area overlaps with enhanced darkness made by a power of 3rd level or lower, the darkness is dispelled.

#### Greater Sabotage Charges
_7th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create six medium sabotage charges that last for the power's duration. When you cast the power, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can hurl up to two of the charges to points you choose within 120 feet. Each charge explodes if it reaches the point or hits a solid surface. Each creature within 10 feet of the explosion must make a Dexterity save. The explosion deals 4d6 fire damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

***Overcharge Tech.*** The number of charges created increases by two for each slot level above 7th.

#### Greater Salvo
_9th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You launch four projectiles at points you can see within range. Each creature within a 20-foot-radius sphere of each point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 15d6 fire damage and 15d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once. 

The power damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

#### Greater Translation Program
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** 1 hour

This power grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken registered language it hears. Moreover, when the target speaks, any creature that knows at least one registered language and can hear the target understands what it says.

#### Greater Translocate
_5th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your form shimmers in a holographic configuration, and then collapses. You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. On each of your turns before the power ends, you can use a bonus action to teleport in this way again.

#### Group Hologram
_5th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** 8 hours, or until the end of your next short or long rest; whichever happens first

This power allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this power.

The power disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The power lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.

The changes wrought by this power fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this power to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this power to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

#### Haywire
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You momentarily surround a creature you can see within range with electronic interference and holographic illusions. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw, or it takes 1d6 lightning damage and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.

The power's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

\columnbreak

#### Hold Droid
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You emit a paralyzing dart at a droid or construct that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the power ends on the target.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional droid or construct for each slot level above 2nd. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

#### Holding Cell
_4th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A sphere of shimmering energy springs into being and encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.

Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other power effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.

The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.

A disintegrate power targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.

#### Holographic Disguise
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 hour

Until the power ends or you use an action to dismiss it, you can disguise yourself through the use of a hologram emitter. You can appear to be shorter or taller by about a foot and change the appearance of your body weight, but you cannot change the basic structure of your body. The hologram can include your clothes, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person. 

The illusion is only visual, so any sort of physical contact will only interact with the real size and shape of you. A creature can use its action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC, seeing through the hologram on a success.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 12 | TECH POWERS</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Hologram
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an image that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual. If anything passes through it, it is revealed to be an illusion.

You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image.

A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

#### Homing Rockets
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 

You lock on to one or more targets within range and expel a series of three small explosives. Each explosive hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. An explosive deals 1d4 + 1 fire damage to its target. The explosives all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the power creates one more explosive for each slot level above 1st.

#### Illusory Strike
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Varies
- **Duration:** 1 round

As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within your reach, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and you create an illusory duplicate of yourself in your space that only the target can see. The target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes against you before the start of your next turn.

This power creates multiple duplicates when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, you create a second illusory duplicate, and the target has disadvantage on the next two attacks it makes against you before the start of your next turn. The number of duplicates and attacks with disadvantage increases to three at 11th level and four at 17th level.

\columnbreak

#### Illusory Terrain
_4th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Duration:** 24 hours 

You make terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of terrain. 

The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.

#### Immolate
_5th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for the power's duration. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, and the power ends on a successful one. These enhanced flames can't be extinguished by unenhanced means.

If damage from this power kills a target, the target is turned to ash.

#### Implant Message
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the power to deliver your message.

When that circumstance occurs, the message is recited in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. When you cast this power, you can have the power end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.

The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the message to play when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a bell rings within 30 feet of it.

#### Incendiary Cloud
_8th-level tech power_

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You create a swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the power's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.

#### Infiltrate
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

#### Invisibility to Cameras
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

This power's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

#### Ionic Bond
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

A beam of ion energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained line between you and the target. Make a ranged tech attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 ion damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use a bonus action to deal 1d8 ion damage to the target automatically. The power ends if you use your bonus action to do anything else. The power also ends if the target is ever outside the power's range or if it has total cover from you.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Ionic Strike
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within your reach, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes wreathed in an ionic discharge. If the target willingly takes a reaction before the start of your next turn, it immediately takes 1d6 ion damage, and the power ends. 

This power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d6 ion damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for taking reactions increases to 2d6. Both damage rolls increase by 1d6 at 11th level and 17th level.

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The power ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the power. When you cast this power, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged tech attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

#### Minor Hologram
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet

This ability is a minor tech trick that creates one of the following effects within range.
- You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor. 
- You instantaneously light or snuff out a source of light. 
- You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot. 
- You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.

#### Mirror Image
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 minute

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the power ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the power's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.

A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The power ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this power if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

#### Mobile Lights

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create up to four orbs of light within range that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this power, and a light winks out if it exceeds the power's range.

#### Motivator Boost
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You imbue a willing droid with heightened speed and maneuverability. Until the power ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, and it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws. 

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional droid for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Neurotoxin
_7th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

- 60 hit points or fewer: poisoned for 1 minute
- 50 hit points or fewer: poisoned and deafened for 1 minute
- 40 hit points or fewer: poisoned, deafened, and blinded for 10 minutes

#### Oil Slick
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You cover the ground in a 10-foot square within range in oil. For the duration, it is difficult terrain.

When the oil appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw.

The oil is flammable. Any 5 foot square of the oil exposed to fire burns away in one round. Each creature who enters the fire or starts it turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

\columnbreak

#### On/Off
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This power allows you to activate or deactivate any electronic device within range, as long as the device is not being wielded by a creature, and has a clearly defined on or off function that can be easily accessed from the outside of the device. Any device that requires a software-based shutdown sequence to activate or deactivate cannot be affected by *on/off*.

#### Overheat
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a blaster or a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the power. Until the power ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.

If an object is held, worn, or integrated, and a creature takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't—or can't—drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Overload
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot cube)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You expel a burst of power. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 ion damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Override Interface
_5th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You choose one droid or construct you can see within range and attempt to remotely override its controls. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the construct has the 'Piloted' trait, and has a pilot controlling it that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot's Intelligence modifier. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by you for the duration.

While the droid is charmed, you have a wireless link with it as long as the two of you are on the same planet. Via your tech focus, you can use this link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Move over there," or "Fetch that object." If the droid completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability. 

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the droid takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well. 

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Intelligence saving throw against the power. If the saving throw succeeds, the power ends.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a 6th-level tech slot, the duration is 10 minutes. When you use a 7th-level tech slot, the duration is 1 hour. When you use a tech slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours.

- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You emit a paralyzing dart at a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for the duration. While poisoned in this way, the target is paralyzed. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the power ends on the target.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 5th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional humanoid for each slot level above 2nd. The humanoids must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

#### Pheromone Burst
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (5-foot sphere)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You expel a burst of mood-altering pheromones around you. Each creature within range other than you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage and become frightened of you until the start of its next turn. A creature that is immune to the poisoned condition is not frightened.

This power's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

#### Poison Dart
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Make a ranged tech attack against a creature within range. On hit, the target takes 2d8 poison damage and must make a Constitution save. On a failed save, it is also poisoned until the end of your next turn.

_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** 8 hours, or until the end of your next short or long rest; whichever happens first

You touch a willing creature, granting them a limited AI companion that can predict the world around them. For the duration, the target can't be surprised and has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target for the duration.

This power immediately ends if you cast it again before its duration ends.

#### Preparedness

#### Pressure Crush
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to crush the body of a creature you touch. The target must make a Strength saving throw. If the creature is grappled or restrained by you or an effect you control, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d12 kinetic damage.

This power's damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).

#### Programmed Illusion
_6th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the power how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.

When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:16px'></div>

&emsp;The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

#### Project Hologram
_7th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 500 miles
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 24 hours

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the power ends.

You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose an area of unenhanced flame that you can see and that fits within a 5-foot cube within range. You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either fireworks or smoke when you do so.

***Fireworks.*** The target explodes with a dazzling display of colors. Each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of your next turn.

***Smoke.*** Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.

#### Radiation
_4th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Dim, greenish light spreads within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The light spreads around corners, and it lasts until the power ends.

When a creature moves into the power's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 4d10 necrotic damage, and it suffers one level of exhaustion and emits a dim, greenish light in a 5-foot radius. This light makes it impossible for the creature to benefit from being invisible. The light and any levels of exhaustion caused by this power go away when the power ends.

#### Read Memory
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

You read the memory of an incapacitated droid or construct within range. The target must have its memory core (and/or other appropriate components) intact.

Until the power ends, you can ask up to five questions. Depending on what it would know or has witnessed, the target provides visual, audio, or text-based data in response. The target can’t provide new information, and can't speculate about future events.

\columnbreak

#### Reboot
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** 1 round

Choose a Medium or smaller droid or construct you can see. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is incapacitated until the start of your next turn. Each time the creature takes damage or is the target of a hostile power while incapacitated in this way, it can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

#### Release
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 

Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of binders, a lock, or another object that contains a mundane or enhanced means that prevents access.

A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.

If you choose a target that is held shut with *lock*, that power is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.

#### Remove Virus
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

At your touch, all tech-based curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed enhanced item, its curse remains, but the power breaks its owner's attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.

#### Repair Droid
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 

A droid or construct you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your techcasting ability modifier.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Reprogram Droid
_5th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** 30 days

You alter the protocols of a droid that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. The droid must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the droid is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 lightning damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but it can only do so once each day.

You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the power ends. You can end the power early by using an action to dismiss it. The *remove virus* power also ends it.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 9th level, the power lasts until it is ended by *remove virus*.

#### Rewrite Memory
_5th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to alter a droid or construct's memories. One droid or construct that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another power, this power ends, and none of the target's memories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.

The target's mind fills in any gaps in the altered memory. If the power ends before you have finished prescribing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the power ends.

A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how the target behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the target's core programming, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the target enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a glitch. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a target in a significant manner.

A *remove virus* or similar power cast on the target restores its true memory.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:16px'></div>

&emsp;***Overcharge Tech.*** If you cast this power using a tech slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level).

#### Rime Shot 
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** Varies
- **Duration:** 1 round 

As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a ranged weapon attack against one creature within your weapon's range, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and the creature gains 1 slowed level until the end of its turn as the air around it turns frigid. 

This power deals additional damage when you reach higher levels. At 5th level the ranged attack deals an extra 1d6 cold damage. This damage increases by 1d6 again at 11th level and 17th level.

#### Rime Strike
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Varies
- **Duration:** 1 round

As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within your reach, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn, as the cold energy seeps into its being. Additionally, if the target doesn't move at least 5 feet before the start of your next turn, it immediately takes 1d8 cold damage, and the power ends. 

This power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 cold damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for not moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.

- **Range:** Self 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  

A wall of flames erupts out of the ground in a ring around you with a radius of 15 feet and a height of 10 feet. Creatures who start their turn in the ring of fire or pass through it on their turn take 1d6 fire damage. Creatures within the ring of fire who willingly try to move through the fire to escape must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to do so. Creatures who are immune to fear or fire automatically succeed on this saving throw. 

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage of the ring of fire increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Sabotage Charges
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create six tiny sabotage charges that last for the power's duration. When you cast the power, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can hurl up to two of the charges to points you choose within 120 feet. Each charge explodes if it reaches the point or hits a solid surface. Each creature within 5 feet of the explosion must make a Dexterity save. The explosion deals 2d6 fire damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

***Overcharge Tech.*** The number of charges created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Salvo
_4th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You launch three projectiles at points you can see within range. Each creature within a 10-foot radius sphere of each point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire and 3d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one sphere is affected only once.

The power damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 6th level or higher, you create four projectiles. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 8th level or higher, you create five projectiles.

#### Scan Area
_4th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Program a creature or object that you are familiar with into your tech focus. Using a sonar scan, the tech focus attempts to find a path to the creature's or objects location, as long as that creature or object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature or object is moving, you know the direction of its movement.

The power can locate a specific creature or object known to you, or the nearest creature/object of a specific kind (such as a droid or a bothan), so long as you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. 

#### Scramble Interface
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You choose one droid or construct you can see within range and scramble its ability to differentiate targets. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the construct has the 'Piloted' trait, and has a pilot controlling it that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot's Intelligence modifier. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies until the power ends. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target, it must choose the target at random from among the creatures it can see within range of the attack, power, or other ability it's using. If an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, the creature must make that attack if it is able to.

#### Scrambling Barrier
_6th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot radius)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.

Any tech power of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the power is cast using a higher level tech slot. Such a power can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the power has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such powers.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks powers of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.

\pagebreakNum

#### Scrambling Field
_8th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot-radius sphere)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A 10-foot-radius shimmering sphere of power suppression surrounds you. Within the sphere, powers can't be cast and enhanced items become mundane. Until the power ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.

Powers and other enhanced effects are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed power is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

***Targeted Effects.*** Powers and other enhanced effects that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.

***Enhanced Areas.*** The area of another power or enhanced effect, such as _explosion_, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an enhanced area, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.

***Powers.*** Any active power or other enhanced effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

***Enhanced Items.*** The properties and powers of enhanced items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 lightsaber in the sphere functions as an unenhanced lightsaber.

An enhanced weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If an enhanced weapon or a piece of enhanced ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire an enhanced shot or throw an enhanced vibrospear at a target outside the sphere), the enhancement of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

***Enhanced Travel.*** Teleportation fails to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such enhanced travel. A portal to another location temporarily closes while in the sphere.

***Creatures and Objects.*** A creature or object summoned or created by powers temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.

***Tech Override/Diminish Tech.*** Powers and enhanced effects such as *tech override* have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different scrambling field powers don't nullify each other.

#### Security Protocols
_6th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** 24 hours 

You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The secured area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the power.

When you cast this power, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.

When commanded (no action required), *security protocols* creates the following effects within the secured area.

***Corridors.*** Fog fills all the secured corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.

***Doors.*** All doors in the secured area are locked, as if sealed by the *lock* power. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an image (equivalent to the illusory object function of the *minor hologram* power) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.

***Stairs.*** Electromesh fills all stairs in the secured area from top to bottom, as the *electromesh* power. This mesh regrows in 10 minutes if it is burned or torn away while *security protocols* lasts.

***Other power effect.*** You can place your choice of one of the following enhanced effects within the secured area of the stronghold.
- Place *mobile lights* in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as *security protocols* lasts.
- Place *implant message* in two locations.
- Place *debilitating gas* in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while *security protocols* lasts.

The whole secured area radiates power. A *diminish tech* cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.

You can create a permanently guarded and secured structure by casting this power there every day for one year.

On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and each Large or smaller creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to the target. 

This power deals additional damage when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the ranged attack deals an extra 1d6 damage. This damage increases by 1d6 again at 11th level and 17th level. The damage is the same type as the weapon's damage.

#### Ward
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 round

You emit a powerful force field that deflects incoming attacks. Until the end of your next turn, you have resistance against kinetic, energy, and ion damage dealt by weapon attacks.

#### Warding Shot
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Varies
- **Duration:** 1 round

As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a ranged weapon attack against one creature within your weapon's range, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and a dim barrier surrounds it. The first time it would deal damage before the start of your next turn, that damage is reduced by 1d6. 

This power's damage reduction increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

#### Wire Bind
_4th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You produce up to 4 wires, which bind creatures of your choice that you can see within range. A creature can be targeted by more than one wire. 

Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw for each wire that targets it. On a failed save, the creature is restrained and falls prone as it is wrapped securely by the wire.

A creature restrained by a wire can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your tech save DC. On a success, it is no longer restrained by that wire. A wire can also be destroyed; each one has AC 15 and 10 hit points, and has immunity to all damage not dealt by melee weapons.

A wire that misses its target or is escaped falls slack and disintegrates, as do all remaining wires when the power ends.

#### Wire Line
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You launch a grappling wire toward a creature you can see within range. Make a melee tech attack against the target. If the attack hits, the creature takes 1d6 kinetic damage, and if the creature is Large or smaller, you pull the creature up to 10 feet closer to you.

This power's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
