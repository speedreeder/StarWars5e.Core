<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/4mYR4C0.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:30px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">haracters are defined by much more than their species</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  and class. They're individuals with their own stories, interests, connections, and capabilities beyond those that class and species define. This section expounds on the details that distinguish characters from one another, including the basics of name and physical description, the rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer points of personality and alignment.

## Character Details
Your character's name and physical description might be the first things that the other players at the table learn about you. It's worth thinking about how these characteristics reflect the character you have in mind.

### Name
Your character's species description includes sample names for members of that species. Put some thought into your name even if you're just picking one from a list.

### Sex
You can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture's expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior.

You don't need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. Some species believe in companionship that doesn't take into account gender. You could also play a female character who presents herself as a man or a man who feels trapped in a female body. Likewise, your character's sexual orientation is for you to decide.

### Height and Weight
You can decide your character's height and weight, using the information provided in your species description. Think about what your character's ability scores might say about his or her height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin. A strong and Durable character might be tall or heavy.

You can also roll randomly for your character's height and weight using that species's Physical Characteristics table, as shown above. The first dice roll given in the second column determines the character's extra height (in inches) beyond the base height. That same number multiplied by the second dice roll or quantity given in the second column determines the character's extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight.

For example, as a human, Obi-Wan has a height of 4 feet 8 inches plus 2d10 inches. We roll 2d10 and gets a total of 12, so Obi-Wan stands 5 feet 8 inches tall. Then we use that same roll of 12 and multiplies it by 2d4 pounds. His 2d4 roll is 3, so Obi-Wan weighs an extra 36 pounds (12x3) on top of his base 110 pounds, for a total of 146 pounds.

### Other Physical Characteristics
You choose your character's age and the color of his or her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness, you might want to give your character an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo.

### Alignment
A typical creature in the galaxy has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality, and is typically defined in terms of the Force: (light, dark, or balanced), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.

These brief summaries describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment. 

You can pick your alignment or roll to determine it randomly. Roll separately for Morality and Society.

|d6|Morality|
|:--:|:--|
|1-2|**Light:** Usually the needs of others outweigh my own, (...)|
|3-4|**Dark:** Usually my needs outweigh others', (...)|
|5-6|**Balanced:** Usually circumstances dictate whose needs are more important, (...)

|d6|Society|
|:--:|:--|
|1-2|**Lawful:** (...) but the means are as important as the end.|
|3-4|**Chaotic:** (...) but the ends justify the means.|
|5-6|**Neutral:** (...) but either the ends or the means may be more important, depending.|

#### Alignment in the Galaxy
For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans and ugnaughts can choose whether to follow the paths of darkness or light, of law or chaos. Lanniks tend to follow the light side, while sith purebloods tend toward the dark. Chiss are lawful, while aqualish are often chaotic.

### Languages
Your species indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.

Choose your languages based on the species you commonly interact with. If you have a wookiee sidekick, you might understand-if not speak-Shyriiwook. Alternatively, if you commonly trade with Jawas, you might speak Jawaese.

A list of the most commonly spoken languages of *Star Wars* can be found below in the Common Languages table.

### Personal Characteristics
Fleshing out your character's personality—the array of traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person a unique identity—will help you bring him or her to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character's favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.

Each background presented later in this chapter includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your imagination. You're not bound to those options, but they're a good starting point.

#### Personality Traits
Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character. They should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out. "I'm smart" is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. "I've read every book I can get my hands on" tells you something specific about your character's interests and disposition.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character's self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.

A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.

#### Ideals
Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.

Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?

You can choose any ideals you like, but your character's alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background in this chapter includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: dark, light, or neutral. The last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives.

#### Bonds
Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character's connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character's motivations and goals.

Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection? What is your most treasured possession?

Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your species, or some other aspect of your character's history or personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your adventures.

#### Flaws
Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character's flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness—in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests. More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you? What's the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?

## Inspiration
Inspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that's true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a power that has been laid on you.

### Gaining Inspiration
Your GM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, GMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.

You either have inspiration or you don't - you can't stockpile multiple "inspirations" for later use.

### Using Inspiration
If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.

Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.

## Backgrounds
Every story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a pit fighter or a grizzled soldier. Your consular could have been a student or an envoy. Your operative might have gotten by as a government agent or commanded audiences as an entertainer.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character's identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

#### Proficiencies
Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills. Skills are described in chapter 7.

In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools. Tools and tool proficiencies are detailed in chapter 5.

If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.

#### Languages
Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by species. See "Languages" earlier in this chapter.

#### Equipment
Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule from chapter 5 to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.

#### Background Feat
Each background gives a character a starting feat. Feats are described in chapter 6. 

#### Suggested Characteristics
A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.

### Customizing a Background
You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, a total of two tool proficiencies or languages, and a feat that lacks a level requirement. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in chapter 5. (If you spend credits, you can't also take the equipment package suggested &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, &nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can't find a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feature that matches your desired background, work &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with your GM to create one.

## Agent
Many organizations active in the galaxy aren't bound by strictures of geography. These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, mercenaries, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or items for use by the faction's operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don't merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, and heart. As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own. Becoming an adventurer doesn't necessarily require you to relinquish membership in your faction (though you can choose to do so), and it might enhance your status in the faction.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Investigation, Lore, and Persuasion
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** Badge or emblem of your faction, a copy of a seminal faction text (or a code-book for a covert faction), a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 150 cr

### Feature: Safe Haven
As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.

### Background Feat
As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:

#### Suggested Characteristics
Agents are shaped by their experience in their faction's communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faction and their relationships to it affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

## Bounty Hunter 
Before you became an adventurer, your life was already full of conflict and excitement, because you made a living tracking down people for pay. Unlike some people who collect bounties, though, you aren't a savage who follows quarry into or through the wilderness. You're involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. What's more, you aren't alone, as a bounty hunter in the wild would be: you routinely interact with both the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining contacts in both areas to help you succeed.

You might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of the city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of street gangs. You might be a "velvet mask" bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists. As a member of an adventuring party, you might find it more difficult to pursue a personal agenda that doesn't fit with the group's objectives - but on the other hand, you can take down much more formidable targets with the help of your companions.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Insight, Persuasion, and Stealth
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Your choice of demolitions kit, security kit, or slicer's kit
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of clothes appropriate to your duties, a set of binders, and a pouch containing 200 cr

### Feature: Ear to the Ground
You are in frequent contact with people in the segment of society that your chosen quarries move through. These people might be associated with the criminal underworld, the rough-and-tumble folk of the streets, or members of high society. This connection comes in the form of a contact in any city you visit, a person who provides information about the people and places of the local area.

### Background Feat
As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:

<div style='column-count:2'>

|d8|Feat|
|:--:|:--:|
|5|Specialist|
|6|Linguist|
|7|Alert|
|8|Athlete|

</div>

#### Suggested Characteristics
Your bond might involve other bounty hunters or the organizations or individuals that employ you. Your ideal could be associated with your determination always to catch your quarry or your desire to maintain your reputation for being dependable.

## Force Adept
You are keenly attuned to the flow of the mysterious energy field known as the Force.  With proper training, you could learn to consciously sense and manipulate that energy further.  As it is, you may appear to have heightened senses, extremely quick reflexes, an intuitive understanding of others, or an uncanny ability to persuade people to your way of thinking. Your powers may have lain dormant for a long time, perhaps you felt something inside of you but never knew what it was. Perhaps your abilities were awoken by a strong encounter with another force-sensitive with the powers of the Force, or an object associated with the Force, such as a lightsaber.

___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Insight, Perception, and Persuasion
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Two of your choice of artisan's implements, gaming sets, or musical instruments
- **Equipment:** A set of common clothes, a sturdy knife, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

### Feature: Guided by the Force
When you attempt to learn a piece of knowledge, you often instinctively know where or from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a seemingly random person, book, or data file. Your GM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found.

### Background Feat
As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:

#### Suggested Characteristics
Force adepts can come from all walks of life and have varied life experiences.  Often, though, there is an underlying influence that the Force has on the personalities of Force Adepts, especially once they begin to be conscious of their connection to the Force.

## Investigator
Rarer than watch or patrol members are a community's investigators, who are responsible for solving crimes after the fact.

### Feature: Watcher's Eye
Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals. You can easily find the local outpost of the watch or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter.

## Jedi
You are a devout follower of the Jedi Order: an ancient, monastic peacekeeping organization united in its observance of the light side of the Force. A noble order of protectors noted for their ability to tap into the power of the Force, the Jedi serve as guardians of peace and justice in the Galactic Republic. You follow the Jedi Code:

<div align="center">

*"There is no emotion, there is peace.<br>
There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.<br>
There is no passion, there is serenity.<br>
There is no chaos, there is harmony.<br>
There is no death, there is the Force."*

You might also have ties to a specific Jedi temple and have a residence there. This could be the temple where you trained, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the Jedi for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Jedi are shaped by their experience in their temple.

## Mercenary
As a sell-sword who fought battles for coin, you're well acquainted with risking life and limb for a chance at a share of treasure. Now, you look forward to fighting foes and reaping even greater rewards as an adventurer. Your experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of events on the battlefield. You might have served with a large outfit or a smaller band of sell-swords, maybe even more than one. 

Now you're looking for something else, perhaps greater reward for the risks you take, or the freedom to choose your own activities. For whatever reason, you're leaving behind the life of a soldier for hire, but your skills are undeniably suited for battle, so now you fight on in a different way.

- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A uniform of your company (traveler's clothes in quality), an insignia of your rank, a gaming set (one of your choice), and a pouch containing the remainder of your last wages (100 cr)

### Feature: Mercenary Life
You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can. You are able to identify mercenary companies by their emblems, and you know a little about any such company, including the names and reputations of its commanders and leaders, and who has hired them recently. You can find the cantinas and feasthalls where mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the language, and if you spend at least an hour in such a location you can come across one of the following bits of information: a job offer, significant rumor, referral to a skilled merchant, blacksmith, etc., or a hint towards the pursuit of your current quest. Additionally, you can find mercenary work between adventures sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle (see "Practicing a Profession" under "Downtime Activities" in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook).

## Noble
You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with manual labor, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land.

Work with your GM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries, as well as your family and their influence on you. Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, how do people regard them?

What's your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family or the head itself? Are you far down the line of succession? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family's good graces? 

Does your family have a coat of arms you might wear, a signet ring, or particular colors? 

These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.

___

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Insight, Lore, and Persuasion
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a letter of pedigree, and a purse containing 250 cr

### Feature: Position of Privilege
Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.

### Background Feat

#### Suggested Characteristics
Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.

## Nomad
You grew up in the wilds, far from civilization and the comforts of town and technology. You've witnessed the migration of herds larger than forests, survived weather more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend, and enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking creature for miles in any direction.

## Pirate
You are an experienced pirate. Banditry and raiding are common in the Outer Rim, and little negative stigma is given to pirates.  Those that prey on the Empire are sometimes even held in high regard as bold warriors. However, you still have contacts within the criminal underworld and you're far closer than most people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by flouting the rules and regulations of finer society.

- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set, your choice of demolitions kit, security kit, or slicer's kit

You've been from one end of the galaxy to the other. You know the most lucrative trade routes. You have expert knowledge of the various hyperlanes. In addition to this, you know a large number of the models and designs of common space ships that are found in the galaxy. Further, the bonds you formed with your crew are strong, and you can call on their aid even if you've been away from their side for some time. You can expect your former comrades to offer you passage aboard ship, reasonable aid, or shelter when you are in need. Keep in mind that this bond goes both ways, and they may come to you expecting the same.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Despite the cutthroat nature of the business, pirates come in all shapes and personalities. Some are bloodthirsty brigands who leave no survivors, others are free spirits who believe in strength over weakness. The hardened warriors of deep space can be implacable foes who often form unshakable bonds with their crewmates. The same circumstances that give them their edge can also grind them down, leaving them vulnerable to greed, shame, and the scars of fear and horror left by battle.

## Scientist
Nothing excites you more than pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge. Most of your time is spent in a lab performing experiments to further your interests. Few people understand the work you do. You can solve complex problems most people can't begin to wrap their heads around, and can solve simple problems in unexpected ways that surprise most people. 

What is your scientific field of interest? Is it your insatiable curiousity, or a personal goal that drives you? Did you leave your lab voluntarily, or were you kicked out? One thing is for sure - there are too many interesting research ideas, and too little time.

Concepts that are complicated, involving technical jargon that usually goes over most people's heads, are simple to you. You fully understand concepts, can recall key information, and know how to use equipment related to your field, unless the research was hidden from the public, in which case you may only partially understand it. You also recognize well-known figures in your field.

You make the improbable sound plausible, and come ahead on every deal.

As a Sith, you instill fear in those who are aware of your standing. When you are in a civilized environment, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a cantina or cutting through doors at a local shop, since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.

### Background Feat
As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:

## Smuggler
You have spent your life hiding in the darkness, making shady deals behind closed doors. What led you to engage in a life of crime? Do you crave the thrill of lawbreaking, or did you enter the profession to pay off a debt, risking your hide on behalf of a less than honorable noble? A smuggler is an individual trained in the art of acquisition, a professional thug who can deliver anything... for a price. Smugglers tend to be bolder criminals than most, preferring bribery or distraction over subterfuge and stealth.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Piloting, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set and your choice of demolitions kit, security kit, or slicer's kit
- **Equipment:** A fusion cutter, a set of dark common clothes including a hood, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

### Feature: Careful Selection
Some close brushes with the law have taught you that not every city guard can be bribed, and some people are simply too keen to miss minute discrepancies. This feature allows you to study a person and gain insight into whether or not they would accept a bribe, or to pick up on whether they are exceptionally more perceptive than you. It does not reveal how expensive a bribe may be for a given situation, however.

### Background Feat
As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:

|6|Specialist|
|7|Feigned Confidence|
|8|Force of Personality|

</div>

#### Suggested Characteristics
Smugglers might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are nefarious to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but spies rarely show any respect for law or authority.

## Soldier
War has been your life for as long as you care to remember. You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You might have been part of a standing national army, a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.

When you choose this background, work with your GM to determine which military organization you were a part of, how far through its ranks you progressed, and what kind of experiences you had during your military career. Was it a standing army, a town guard, a village militia, or perhaps a private company.

### Feature: Military Rank
You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments where your rank is recognized.
