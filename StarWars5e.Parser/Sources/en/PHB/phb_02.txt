<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/TP83mUX.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:35px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">visit to any of the great cities in the worlds of</span><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Star Wars* overwhelms the senses. Voices chatter in countless different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens of different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of their inhabitants. 

And the people themselves-people of varying size, shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles and hues-represent many different species, from diminutive bothans and stalwart cereans to majestic twi'leks and towering wookiees, mingling among a variety of human ethnicities.

Scattered among the members of these more common species are the true exotics: a hulking besalisk here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly chiss there, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A group of jawas chatters as one of them activates a clever mechanical toy that moves of its own accord. Zabraks and devaronians live and work alongside humans, without fully belonging. And there, well out of the sunlight, is a lone dros-a fugitive from the the Galactic Republic, trying to make his way in a world.

### Choosing a Species
Humans are the most common people in the worlds of *Star Wars*, but they live and work alongside ithorians, kiffar, mirialan, and countless other fantastic species. Your character belongs to one of these peoples. 

Your choice of species affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character's adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play. For example, a bothan can be a good choice for a sneaky operative, a wookiee makes a tough berserker, and a twi'lek can be a master of the Force.

Your character species not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character's story. Each species' description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that species, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and special alignment tendencies. These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;species. It's worthwhile to consider why your<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;character is different, as a helpful way to think<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;about your character's background and<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; personality.

### Special Traits
The description of each species includes special traits that are common to members of that species. The following entries appear among the traits of most species.

#### Ability Score Increase
Every species increases one or more of a character's ability scores.

#### Age
The age entry notes the age when a member of the species is considered an adult, as well as the species' expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

#### Alignment
Most species have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your sith pureblood follows the light side, for example, in defiance of the Sith Empire can help you better define your character.

#### Size
Characters of most species are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few species are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons and heavy shields, as explained in chapter 6.

#### Speed
Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9).

#### Languages
By virtue of your species, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. Each species typically speaks, or at least understands, Galactic Basic as well as having a unique language of their own. Chapter 4 lists the most common languages of the *Star Wars* universe.

<div style='margin-top:47px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Bith are craniopods with pale pink, yellow, or green skin, large heads, large lidless eyes, toeless feet, and long fingers. Their thumb and small finger were both fully opposable. The bith's internal systems are different from most humanoids, as the bith have only one lung, and exhale through their skin. Bith also lack a proper nose, instead having highly sensitive olfactory organs hidden in the skin-flaps of their cheeks.

The other bith senses are also acute. Bith can sense the tonal qualities of sound as well as other species sensed colors. Their eyes, as big as a Menahuun's, can see microscopic details of nearby objects, but are extremely nearsighted as a result. An interesting side effect of their incredible sensors is the effect of sonic grenades, or screamers, on them. It is described as causing their heads to explode. Similarly, bith have high manual dexterity which helps them manipulate fine tools, though their physical prowess with gross motor skills was only average.

### Society and Culture
Bith are one of the galaxy's most ancient civilizations, with a history going back millions of years. This antiquity garners respect in certain quarters, such as among the Gree, who gave them more respect than other, "younger" species. Their society is highly regimented, with everything from mate selection to political leadership controlled by sophisticated computer programs.

### Names
Bith names are quite diverse. Some names look complicated and difficult to pronounce, while others are quite simple. 

**Male Names.** Fedu, Jenkiss, Kabadons, Ph'teumkiass 

**Female Names.** Duhia, F'hubama, R'hothal, Thidus 

**Surnames.** D'intes, Hern, K'sarorn, Nimum, Rumo

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Bothans are a short species of furry humanoids. Bothans are covered in fur which shifted in response to their emotional state by way of gentle ripplings. It is this trait, named Wrendui, that betrays them when members of their kind intend to be duplicitous in their dealings with others. They possess tapered pointed ears, and both males and females were known to sport beards. 

Bothans are able to interbreed with the other species, though it is rare that they do so. Such hybrids somewhat resembled baseline humans with haunches, hooves, fur, pointed ears and a long tail.

### Society and Culture
Bothan culture is guided by the philosophy and principles from the ancient text known as The Way, written by Golm Fervse'dra. In this "Bothan Way", the pursuit of power and influence is paramount. Thus, individual bothans put their own political and economic success above all other concerns, and as a species, bothans put their own advancement ahead of other intergalactic interests. The volume of backstabbing, subtle character assassination and political maneuvering in bothan society is dizzying, and results in many species stereotyping bothans as untrustworthy. In fact, most bothans are habitually paranoid, believing that anyone who's not working with them, is working against them. In times of crisis, the focus of bothan society shifts to a survivalist state known as "ar'krai". When engaged in ar'krai, all fit bothans volunteer to defend their species from impending extinction. 

### Names
Male bothan names are often trickey while female's are soft. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Garc, Hibriak, Nith, Tramom, Ventagt 

**Female Names.** Ceerriah, Dhaim, Gnam, Meenn, Vit 

**Surnames.** Bwif'livi, Gra'kit, Hia'faitu, Main'dil

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:413px'></div>

### Bothan Traits
As a bothan, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Bothans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Bothans' duplicitous nature causes them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Bothans stand 4-5 feet tall and weigh under 100 pounds. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Naturally Stealthy.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is your size or larger than you.

***Nimble Escape.*** You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of your turns.

> While bothans are suitable for many classes, they most iconically fit as operatives. The ***Nimble Escape*** special trait heavily overlaps with the operative's ***Cunning Action*** feature, however, making this species/class combination counterintuitive. If, during the character creation part of your game, a player decides to make a bothan operative, consider letting them use the following feature instead:
>
> ***Versatile Expertise.*** You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice. You gain expertise in one skill of your choice in which you are proficient.

&emsp;***Shrewd.*** You are proficient in the Insight and Deception skills.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Bothese. Bothese had a great influence on the forming of Galactic Basic; the two languages share many cognates.

### Biology and Appearance
The Cathar have fur-covered bodies with thick manes as well as prominent, retractable claws that can deliver powerful killing attacks on foes and prey. Their bodies also possess rapid healing abilities. These traits make them the perfect hand-to-hand specialists.

The Cathar species also has two subspecies, known as the Juhani and the Myr Rho. Both of these are notably less catlike than mainline Cathar. Cathar are born into a litter. The Cathar species is biologically similar to the Bothan species.

### Society and Culture
On their homeworld, Cathar live in cities built into giant trees, and are organized into clans governed by elders. Stories of their great heroes were often carved into the trunks of these tree-homes for following generations to see. The Cathar mate for life, to the extent that when one mate dies, the survivor never has a relationship with another. Cathar clan society includes great pageants and celebrations, especially for their heroes. Their religion includes a ritual known as the "Blood Hunt," in which Cathar warriors individually engaged in combat against entire nests of Kiltik in order to gain honor and purge themselves of inner darkness. The native language of the Cathar is Catharese, which included the emphasis of some spoken words with a growl.

### Names
Cathar names can sound both melodic and fairly gutteral, but they almost always sound strong and fierce. Female names are typically longer than male names. Surnames are usually one syllable.

**Male Names.** Crurbirr, Isyrr, Nynorr, Suro, Tukarr 

**Female Names.** Cuwin, Jyvohr, Mulahr, Solyri

**Surnames.** Jin, Ki, Mak, Rhir, Ta

<div style='margin-top:54px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The Cereans' enlarged skulls, extending above their foreheads, house complex binary brains, provided with sufficient blood by an extra heart in their heads. The binary structure of Cerean thinking helps them to ponder two sides of an issue at once. It also enables them to process information and solve problems rapidly and provides a highly advanced capacity for concentration and meditation. Because of their thoughtful nature, they tend to be calm, rational and analytical, preferring peaceful philosophies and a lifestyle which works in harmony with nature. Though the quick-thinking Cereans have equally quick reflexes, they are commonly not as well coordinated as humans. 

### Society and Culture
Cereans developed a low-tech society on their homeworld and prefer to live in isolation from the wider galaxy. Preserving the natural beauty of Cerea, the planet is home to many Outsider Citadels where it is permissible to use offworld technology, though it could not be removed from the Citadel. Meditation is a core part of a Cerean's daily rituals, with many employing specially-forged kasha crystals as a focusing tool. By focusing one's thoughts while in contact with such crystals, distractions are eliminated, creating an exceptional meditation environment. Cerean Jedi sometimes incorporate these crystals into their lightsabers, providing great focus, even during intense physical combat.

### Names
Cerean male first names are often hyphenated, while females are not. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Ji-Cheelia, Ki-Adi, Pick-toh, Sauli-Fanz

**Female Names.** Dreash, Kilniavy, Melm, Rharoth

**Surnames.** Codux, Emkom, Kyureft, Lonnik, Mundi

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Cereans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Cereans' altruistic nature causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Cereans typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh about 150 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Intuitive Initiative.*** You can choose to reroll Initiative checks, but you must use the new roll.

***Natural Instinct.*** You have proficiency with Nature or Perception (your choice).

***Prediction.*** You can embrace the Force and use your advanced insight to predict likely outcomes, allowing you to turn failures into successes. When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

***Second Heart.*** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

***Trance.*** You only need 3 hours of sleep during a long rest to gain its benefits, instead of 6. Additionally, if your long rest would be interrupted, you only need to complete the long rest instead of restarting it to gain its benefits.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Cerean. Cerean is characterized by its gravelly sounds.

<div style='margin-top:56px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The chiss are a near-human species distinguished by their blue skin and glowing red eyes. Genetic analysis indicate that they are an offshoot of humanity, and it is believed that moving underground led to a divergence between them and baseline Humans. Their blue skin, jet black hair and red eyes generally command attention; these features make them physically striking and instantly recognizable.

### Society and Culture
Chiss society is highly structured and ordered with the rule of law being enforced by a group of four affiliations known as the Ruling Families: the Csapla, Nuruodo, Inrokini and Sabosen. These are not biological family groupings but instead different branches of their government. Every chiss claims affiliation to one of the four families, as determined by both tradition and place of birth. The family names are more of a cultural holdover; the bloodlines had grown so co-meddled that any chiss could claim affiliation to any of the ruling families. In spite of the outward impression of calm and order that the chiss like to project to outsiders, there were evidently tensions within the Families; political assassinations are a real part of chiss political life for the Ruling Families.

### Names
A chiss true-name has 3 parts, each separated by an apostrophe. The first part is their family name, the second part is their root name, and the third part is their occupation. Chiss rarely share their true-name with non-chiss, and usually go by their root name. Male and female names do not significantly deviate.

**Names.** Crorcu'ecuk'unist, Dash'esoru'ishur, Jerd'ecer'lonii, Kisk'egauw'eqhi, Marag'aliphil'eduo, Pommo'icuote'nlerme, Vornu'wuzi'lerdim

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Chiss reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Chiss' tactical and selfish nature cause them to tend toward lawful dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Chiss typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh about 160 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Martial Proficiency.*** You have proficiency with light and medium armor as well as the heavy pistol and sniper rifle.

***Politically Minded.*** You have proficiency in the Insight skill.

***Tech Resistance.*** Growing up around technology leaves an impact on chiss. You have advantage on Dexterity and Intelligence saving throws against tech powers.

***Superior Darkvision.*** Your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic, Cheunh, and your choice of Minnisiat or Sy Bisti. Cheunh is a complex language that is difficult for non-chiss to learn. Chiss take pride in this difficulty. Communications with outsiders are conducted through local trade-languages like Minnisiat or Sy Bisti.

<div style='margin-top:54px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
A bipedal mammalian species, Devaronians evolved in the dense jungles of Devaron as a hunter-gather species. Their bodies are denser than most humanoids' and as a result they were heavier than their<br> appearance would tend to indicate. Devaronians have<br> silver-based blood, which appears thick and black<br> when exposed. They possess a unique blood filtration<br> and cleansing system which processes through two<br> livers. Because their bodies are constantly cleansed of<br> toxins and carcinogens, the species is highly resistant<br> to poison. To this end, sulfur is used as a stimulant on<br> Devaron to enhance speed and strength, because<br> inhaling it causes the substance to enter the<br> bloodstream rapidly. Their livers struggle to eliminate<br> sulfur from their system, meaning that long-term use<br> can be dangerous.

### Society and Culture
Devaronian males are driven by an urge to wander, usually taking the first opportunity to move on from one place to another; they are often found traveling the galaxy as tramp freighter captains and scouts. Female Devaronians, on the other hand, are content to remain in a single location, raising the young and running the government of Devaron. The males send money back to their homeworld to support their families, but otherwise hardly ever return. The females are content with this arrangement, as they tend to view the restless males as disruptive to home life. 

### Names
Devaronian names are dark, complex and often guttural, with some harsher tones mixed in here and there.

**Male Names.** Cir, Gremegris, Keirtihk, Kucx, Niruhk

**Female Names.** Crilnuy, Ghal, Milma, Nola, Taoluel 

**Surnames.** Breiz, Droddost, G'vaulnel, Raokt

<div style='margin-top:398px'></div>

### Devaronian Traits
As a devaronian, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by<br> 1.

***Age.*** Devaronians reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Devaronians' greediness causes them to tend toward chaotic balanced, though there are<br> exceptions.

***Size.*** Devaronians typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh about 160 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Curiosity.*** You have proficiency with Survival or Investigation (your choice).

***Heat Adaptation.*** You have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion due to extreme heat.

***Jungle Dweller.*** Growing up in the jungles of Devaron has left an impact. You don’t treat jungle terrain as difficult terrain.

***Silver Tongue.*** You have proficiency with Deception or Persuasion (your choice).

***Tech Resistance.*** Growing up around technology leaves an impact on devaronians. You have advantage on Dexterity and Intelligence saving throws against tech powers.

***Two Livered.*** Devaronians have two livers, which makes them adept at filtering toxins. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage (explained in chapter 9).

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Devaronese. Devaronese is characterized by grunts and grumbles. It is rare to hear a Devaronian speak it anywhere other than their homeworld of Devaron.

<div style='margin-top:19px'></div>

### Biology and Appearence
The duros are humanoids with smooth blue-green skin, red eyes, lipless mouths, long thin noseless faces and green blood. Olfactory organs beneath their eyes are responsible for their sense of smell. Both females and males are bald, though both genders are easily distinguished. Their large red goggle-like eyes have slit pupils. Duros females lay eggs as they are descended from ancient reptiles, and they are born in a larval grub stage. Unlike similar species, the duros take care of their offspring from birth.

### Society and Culture
Their home planet Duro is primarily uninhabited due to massive pollution on the world over time. Instead, it is covered with automated farms for food production. The duros live in twenty orbital space cities above the planet.

The duros also established a vast, grand starship construction industry in the Duro system. The duros set up their government around a consortium of starship construction corporations, with all important political decisions made by the stockholders of the corporations. This meant that any duros that held stock in a company could participate in the administration of the system.

With their strong memories, some duros also choose to become extraordinary storytellers, renowned galaxy-wide for their ability to learn a wide range of narratives by heart, and perform them all with stunning accuracy. 

### Names
Duros names are generally melodic, with female names having softer intonations. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Cir, Fod, Mom, Rur, Zim

**Female Names.** Chochi, Fumsu, Kaleshef, Raada

**Surnames.** Dektuks, Jimoks, Silt, Tuzig, Zhoks

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Galactic Traveler.*** You have proficiency in the Piloting and Lore skills.

***Navigators.*** You have proficiency in surveyor's implements.

***Superior Memory.*** You can double your proficiency bonus for it when you make an Intelligence (Lore) check to recall information you have learned, or to recall the details of your experiences.

***Tech Resistance.*** Growing up around technology leaves an impact on duros. You have advantage on Dexterity and Intelligence saving throws against tech powers.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Durese. Durese is a common interstellar tongue used by prominent spacers and traders.

### Biology and Appearance
Ewoks are sentient humanoid mammals, averaging about one meter in height, which can provide an advantage when trying to hide. They are covered in fur from head to toe, with brown and black the most common colors. Other Ewoks have near-white or reddish fur, but red fur is supposedly the rarest shade an Ewok can get. Most Ewoks have solid-colored fur, though a few sport stripes. Ewoks have large, bright eyes, small humanoid noses, and hands that possess two fingers and an opposable thumb. Despite their small size, Ewoks are physically strong enough to overpower combat-trained Humans. Their appearance has been likened to "little bears," though they are sometimes referred to as "mini Wookiees."

### Society and Culture
Most Ewoks live high among the trees of the forest moon, in villages built between the closely spaced trees. The basic design of a tree village has a "Central Village" of thatched-roof huts on the primary limbs. These huts are high enough above the ground to be out of reach of predators. Suspended bridges connect the gaps between trees, adjoining distant huts. Knotted rope ladders allow access up or down.

Ewoks enjoy singing and playing music during celebrations and rituals. They are resourceful and tend to make use of everything they get their hands on; they use a variety of crude drums, horns, flutes, and other instruments in their music.

### Names
Ewok names are comprised of growled consonants. Female names always end in a vowel. Surnames are clan-based.

**Male Names.** Coostick, Erphek, Grarphil, Moodoo

**Female Names.** Booshi, Chela, Fesasha, Lipe, Ypezzi

<div style='margin-top:50px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Although a typical gamorrean is squat, green, and heavily built, not all shared these characteristics. Most gamorreans have a dark greenish coloration over a large portion of their bodies; however skin coloration does vary, particularly among females, with light skinned and two-toned pigmentation not uncommon. Black, brown, pinkish yellow, and even a rare white pigmentation are possible. Males tended to have less skin variation and had a greater tendency towards dark green skin perhaps because of their higher exposure to the radiation of the Gamorr Star. Eye coloration varied evenly between gold-yellow, blue, black and brown. The gamorreans generally put no importance on skin or eye coloration although there were some superstitions linked to certain markings.

### Society and Culture
Gamorreans are organized into clans ruled by a male warlord and his wife, who was the most powerful of the clan matrons. While the warlord and his boars are solely concerned with preparing and participating in battle with rival clans, the matrons of the clan performed all the productive work including farming, hunting, manufacturing, and running businesses. Since the amount of available arable land on Gamorr is scarce, clans often lay claim to the same piece of land, and they spend their time fighting over possession. 

### Names
Gamorrean names are very gutteral and rough. Male names are typically one syllable while females are two. Surnames are based on clan affiliation rather than family. 

**Male Names.** Ark, Blarrp, Blubrak, Cuab, Shos

**Female Names.** Dabrisz, Mernoos, Ogreb, Tagorq

**Surnames.** Doofnarq, Griks, Lurc, Poogmokk

<div style='margin-top:47px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Starting life as tadpoles, Gungans develop into tall beings with extremely flexible cartilaginous skeletons. Strong leg muscles allow for powerful and quick frog-kick style swimming through water as well as a remarkable jumping ability while on land. Fin-like ears (called haillu) also aid them in swimming, as well as expressing emotions like aggression, friendship, and fear. They have partially retractable eyestalks with nictitating membranes when underwater. Green eyes are unusual amongst Gungans.

### Society and Culture
Gungans are generally a generous and peaceful species. They truly love to have visitors and warmly welcome them; however, they would remain suspicious until the visitors have earned their respect. Gungans are not tolerant of anyone who threatens their peaceful culture. They have very strict laws, and will go to the extremes to punish anyone who has committed a minor crime. Vandals, for example, can be given a sentence of exile, caning, or even stoning.

If a Gungan is cast out of society, it is very difficult for them to return. If they do manage to return legally, they are often subjected to heavy discrimination. This can make life very difficult for them and can go on for months or years, until their past offenses disappear from memory. Returning back to the settlement they were exiled from illegally will sometimes result in the death penalty, especially if they brought along outsiders. 

### Names
Gungan names are often repeated syllables hyphenated.

**Male Names.** Crinn-Crinn, Gic, Noc-Noc, Wal

**Female Names.** Hew, Khi, La-La, Phro-Phro, Yuss

**Surnames.** Baud, Gos, Jalles, Mag, Wub

### Biology and Appearance
Humans are an intelligent species that originated on Coruscant, but can be found on many other planets across the galaxy, including Naboo, Tatooine, and Alderaan. They come in two sexes, male and female, and give birth to live young. They are bipedal beings with a bilateral symmetry, having a front and a back end, as well as an upside and downside. Their bodies are comprised of a torso with a head and four limbs attached to it. The upper limbs, or arms, end in hands which had five fingers each; the lower ones, called legs, end in feet. The human fingers have multiple points of articulation, and one of them is an opposable thumb that allowed for fine manipulation. Finally, they have one head perched atop their torso. Many other species, including twi'leks, mon calamari, or zabraks, are referred to as "humanoids" because of their structural resemblance to humans.

### Society and Culture
Humans can occupy a variety of employs, from politicians to bounty hunters, swoop racers, smugglers, or even a farmer. There exist many planetary groups of humans with their own cultures, such as the Alderaanians or the Pamarthens. Humans are the most populous species in the Galaxy.

### Names
Humans are the most populace species in the Galaxy, and thus their names vary drastically based on the planet or culture with whom they reside.

**Male Names.** Koth, Liorz, Satapak, Tin, Vuc

**Female Names.** Dhetia, Jhilk, Risha, Thinnih, Tonu

**Surnames.** Jauli, Kudi, Melmi, Windu, Wobec

<div style='margin-top:502px'></div>

### Human Traits
As a human, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** One ability score of your choice increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1. Alternatively, four ability scores of your choice each increase by 1.

***Age.*** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.

***Size.*** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Defiant.*** Humans are known to be stubborn and often refuse to give up, even against the worst odds. When you or a creature you can see that can see and understand you makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can roll a d4 and add it to their roll (no action required). Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

***Human Versatility.*** You gain proficiency in one skill, one tool, and one weapon of your choice.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: trandoshan curses, twi'lek musical expressions, chiss military phrases, and so on.

<div style='margin-top:33px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Ithorians have two mouths and four throats, allowing them to speak in stereo. Female Ithorians have two humps on the back of their head, while males have only one. They have glossy, usually brown flesh. Their reflexes and coordination are somewhat slower than that of average humanoids.

In addition to allowing them to speak their unique stereophonic language, the Ithorians' four throats also have the ability to violently expel air, resulting in a deafening and potentially concussive scream. Despite this fact, most Ithorians go their entire lives without ever resorting to violence, and so the ability remained relatively ambiguous.

### Society and Culture
Ithorians worship the "Mother Jungle," a spiritual entity embodying the lush, tropical ecology of their world, Ithor. They are generally devoted environmentalists, staunch herbivores, and complete pacifists, devoting much time to contemplating their ecology, studying plants and their uses and the overall respecting of all living things. Most Ithorians never set foot on their own planet, instead living in floating cities above their world called herdships. Only three of their continents have been explored and harvested, the other two never having been touched by Ithorian hands. They demonstrate extreme belief in the protection and sustaining of their environment as dictated by their "Law of Life."

### Names
Ithorian names are quite varied in length but most names are soft and melodic. They are often difficult to prounounce by other species, so many Ithorians adopt nicknames.

**Male Names.** Del, Gizorthej, Pexxocl, Steorthibs

**Female Names.** Binshe, Dhu'sha, Mul, Slosh, Vlo

**Surnames.** Afleehl, Crukid, Tondand, Wamunn

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:354px'></div>

### Ithorian Traits
As an Ithorian, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Ithorians reach adulthood in their late teens and live an average of 85 years.

***Alignment.*** Ithorians tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Shorter Ithorians stand around 6 feet while taller reach over 7 and a half. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Call for Peace.*** As an action on your turn, you can emphatically demand that your foes embrace peace, thereby distracting them. Until the end of your next turn, enemies within 10 feet of you that can see you gain disadvantage on attack rolls against your allies. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Hold Breath.*** Ithorians have a great lung capacity and can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes at a time.

***Law of Life.*** Ithorians have a sacred respect for the natural world, taking great care to preserve and study it. You have proficiency in the Nature skill and the bioanalysis kit.

***Sonic Scream.*** As an action, you can violently expel air in a 15-foot cone. When you do so, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). A creature takes 2d6 sonic damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 4d6 at 5th level, 6d6 at 11th level, and 8d6 at 17th level. This ability has no effect on constructs. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Ithorese. You can understand spoken and written Galactic Basic, but your vocal cords do not allow you to speak it.

<div style='margin-top:77px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Jawas are easily identifiable by their traditional brown hooded robes, though it is not unheard of for them to wear other colors. Other notable features included their glowing yellow eyes, small stature and high pitched, quickly spoken language called Jawaese. Underneath their robes, jawas appear to be gaunt, rodent-like creatures, with shrunken faces and yellow eyes. 

### Society and Culture
Jawas are a communal, compulsive scavenger species who spend most of their life devoted to scavenging the deserts of Tatooine in search of any scrap metal, droid or mechanical part left behind from millennia of star travel and technological advancement. Most non-jawas regard the jawas as scavengers and thieves, a description that most jawas actually find pleasing.

The jawa's unofficial motto is *not to look for uses in a salvaged item, but rather to imagine someone else who might find a use for it.* This is evidenced in their endless search for wares with which to trade with almost any being jawas encounter. They have a kind of instinctive feel for machinery and electronics, notorious for knowing how to get a piece of equipment functioning just well enough to sell.

### Names
Jawa names are quickly spoken, complex, and often misunderstood. Jawas who spend the majority of their time around other species respond well to nicknames. Male and female names do not significantly deviate. Surnames are clan based.

**Male names.** Bilvu, Mnak, Penk, Plin, Vih

**Female names.** Bahimos, Kola, Levu, Rhovi, Uvet

**Surnames.** Kkejenem, M'avoe, Tjoteelt, Wiamoel

### Jawa Traits
As a jawa, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Jawas are considered adults when they make their first sale and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Jawas tendency to steal and swindle causes them to tend towards the dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Jawas stand around 3 to 4 feet tall and weigh about 40 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Grovel, Cower, and Beg.*** As an action on your turn, you can cower pathetically to distract nearby foes. Until the end of your next turn, your allies gain advantage on attack rolls against enemies within 10 feet of you that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Heat Adaptation.*** You have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion due to extreme heat.

***Tech Dabbler.*** You know the *ion blast* at-will tech power. When you reach 3rd level, you learn and can cast the *repair droid* tech power once per long rest. When you reach 5th level, you learn and can cast the *hold droid* tech power once per long rest. Your techcasting ability is Intelligence. You do not require use of a wristpad for these powers.

***Thieving.*** You have proficiency in the Sleight of Hand skill.

***Tinker.*** You have proficiency with tinker’s implements. You can use these and spend 1 hour and 100 cr worth of materials to construct a Tiny Device (AC 5, 1 hp). You can take the Use an Object action to have your device cause one of the following effects: create a small explosion, create a repeating loud noise for 1 minute, create smoke for 1 minute, cause a small electrical fire. You can maintain a number of these devices up to your proficiency bonus at once, and a device stops functioning after 24 hours away from you. You can dismantle the device to reclaim the materials used to create it.

***Undersized.*** Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons. You can’t use heavy shields. Additionally, you can’t use martial weapons with the two-handed property unless it also has the light property, and if a martial weapon has the versatile property, you can only wield it in two hands.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Jawaese (and the Jawa Trade Language). You can understand spoken and written Galactic Basic, but your vocal cords do not allow you to speak it. Jawaese blends quickly spoken, semi-meaningless syllables with scents to be understood. To more easily bargain and trade with other species, they rely on a simplified variant called the Jawa Trade language which removes the use of scent.

<div style='margin-top:64px'></div>

### Biology and Appearence
Due to Dorin having a unique atmosphere composed of helium and a gas unique to their world, the kel dors are forced to wear an antiox breath mask and protective goggles whenever in atmospheres of a different composition. Without their protective goggles, kel dors were considered effectively blind when away from Dorin. They were also able to survive in the vacuum of space for a short time, though it was unknown exactly how long they could withstand it.

The kel dors also have heightened reflexes, a result of the extrasensory organs in their heads. They are typically quick and wise. 

### Society and Culture
Kel dors are noted for their simple approach to justice, and they typically see moral issues in black and white. On the one hand, the kel dor are noted for their hospitality; they would never turn away a stranger in need. Yet, kel dors are not averse to taking the law into their own hands, and have no compunctions about putting to death a thief who was merely stealing to feed himself.

Kel dor Force-sensitives are often trained as Baran Do Sages, who have an honored place in kel dor culture. They often serve as advisers to rich and powerful kel dor families. Wars and disasters have been averted simply by the insight of a Baran Do Sage.

### Names
Kel dor names are base on sound generated by Dorin's unique atmosphere. Surnames are based on ancient family trades.

**Male Names.** Bil, I'zers, Nullo, Taciss, Zaln

**Female Names.** Arri'ku, Bhi're, Chu, So'ro, Thirza

**Surnames.** Andugai, Borak, Haimnech, Vitchess

### Kel Dor Traits
As a kel dor, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Kel dor reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Kel dors' structured nature causes them to tend toward lawful balanced, though there are<br> exceptions.

***Size.*** Kel dor typically stand around 6 feet tall and weigh about 160 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Your natural evolution allows you to see what others do not in dim and dark conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Foreign Biology.*** You cannot breathe oxygen. The kel dors have created a breathing apparatus to negate the negative effects of living in an oxygen rich environment, but if your mask is removed while you are in such an environment, you lose consciousness.

***Life in the Void.*** You have resistance to necrotic damage, and while exposed to the vacuum of space, you can survive for a number of hours equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 hour), instead of a number of rounds.

***Telepathy.*** You can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet of you. You must share a language with the target in order to communicate in this way. 

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Kel Dor.

<div style='margin-top:66px'></div>

### Biology and Appearence
The mon calamari are a bipedal, amphibious species with high-domed heads, webbed hands and large, goggle-like eyes. In addition to being webbed, the mon calamari hand presents three suction-cup like holes on its palm, and featured five claw-tipped fingers: one opposable thumb, two long middle fingers, and two very short outer fingers. Although they are shaped like flippers, their feet can nevertheless fit into boots designed for human-like feet. The females are distinguished from the males by their more prominent chest areas.

### Society and Culture
The mon calamari have developed a very advanced<br> and civilized culture. Their art, music, literature, and<br> science show a creativity surpassed by few in the<br> galaxy. Mon calamari literature depicts stars as islands<br> in a galactic sea, showing a passionate longing to<br> explore space and discover other civilizations. Mon<br> Calamari are both soft-spoken and gentle, slow to<br> anger, and have the remarkable ability to maintain<br> their concentration without being distracted by<br> emotional responses. They are both inquisitive and<br> creative, and have a near-legendary quality of being<br> both determined and dedicated; once a mon calamari<br> decides on a course of action, they are not easily<br> swayed from that decision. They often fixate<br> themselves on "lost causes." 

### Names
Mon calamari names generally have a melodic feel.

**Male Names.** Creaz, Fior, Hurneerth, Nurrins, Sielpa

**Female Names.** Afwa, Lel, Mhirim, Ri, Theya

**Surnames.** Dualda, Gradi, Tua, Valec, Winab

<div style='margin-top:62px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Nautolans possess physiology common to amphibious species, including low light vision and excellent swimming skills. Their bony endoskeleton and dense cartilage make them tough and resistant to glancing blows. An egg-laying species, Nautolans emerge from their egg as a tadpole that develops arms, legs, and head-tails during their second year of life. Roughly the same size as a Human infant during this time, their limbs are weak and unable to support their weight, forcing youthful Nautolans to remain in aquatic environments for much of their childhood. 

### Society and Culture
The society developed by the Nautolans on Glee Anselm is centralized around local families and governments. The centralized government of Glee Anselm is comprised of representatives from the Council of Elders that govern each settlement. Elders are elected on merit, and can be made up of youthful politicians as well as the most aged members of the society. A culture that promotes life-long mates, Nautolan families are characterized by their loyalty between spouses and the equality of the sexes in the household. Arranged marriages are not uncommon. 

No cultural affinity for the Force ever developed on Glee Anselm, though members of the Nautolan species recognize its importance and respected those among them that were Forceful.

### Names
Nautolan names are generally short and melodic. Female names usually end in a vowel. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Brod, Knirkoc, Peng, Tikuwik, Zesufreat

**Female Names.** Doli, Hahi, Thamlymyo, Usha, Zezu

**Surnames.** Iarre, Rirrall, Sompanong, Uzumdall

### Nautolan Traits
As a Nautolan, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Nautolans reach adulthood in their early teens and live about 70 years on average.

***Alignment.*** Nautolans' benevolence cause them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Nautolans typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and rarely weigh more than 160 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Acute Smell.*** Whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check involving smell, you are considered to have expertise in the Perception skill.

***Amphibious.*** You can breathe air and water.

***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to life underwater, you have superior vision in low light conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. 

***Natural Empathy.*** Nautolan head tentacles are adept at determining moods. You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine emotions against humanoids and beasts within 10 feet of you.

***Swim.*** You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Nautila. Nautila is unique in that it can only be properly pronounced underwater due to its use of pheromones in addition to spoken sounds. In any other environment, the language loses a great amount of detail; that nautolans find this annoying.

<div style='margin-top:78px'></div>

### Biology and Appearence
The rodians are green-skinned humanoids from the planet Rodia. They possess distinctive faces: large, round, multifaceted eyes; tapir-like snouts; and a pair of saucer-shaped antennae on their heads, which served to detect vibrations. The flexible snouts augmented the rodians' finely tuned olfactory senses, collecting and filtering the air. Their characteristically large eyes indicated a primarily nocturnal ancestry and were capable of seeing into the infrared part of the spectrum. Due to their love of fighting and active lifestyles, most rodians kept in good condition, normally lean and wiry; however, some wealthy rodians became complacent and obese.

### Society and Culture
Rodian culture is obsessed with violence and death, due to behaviors and practices that are ingrained since their earliest ancestry. Their densely packed jungle homeworld is ill-suited for agriculture, requiring rodians to compete with vicious predators for most of their food, some of which can wipe out entire rodian villages. As the rodians developed cunning hunting tactics to survive, the hunt became central to their culture. Eventually, having driven most of the other predators on the planet to near extinction, they began to hunt each other in various wars and gladiatorial contests.

### Names
Female names tend to be longer than male names. Surnames are familial.

<div style='margin-top:92px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Sith are a proud and violent species of humanoids that evolved on Korriban, a planet within the Horuset system in an isolated Outer Rim region called the Stygian Caldera. Sith have a larger than average number of individuals with potential to use the Force in their species, so high in fact that the entire species was considered strongly Force-sensitive. 

Sith purebloods are characterized by their expressive facial appendages, bone spurs, cranial horns, and predatory gaze.

### Society and Culture
Sith culture is a rigid and stratified caste-based society. For the sith, war and violence are just as much a part of the natural order of life as peace or serenity. Though they are in an almost constant state of war, their civilization is quite sophisticated; they see these acts not as cruel or barbaric, but simply basic aspects of existence. Their constant warring led to a dwindling of the population on their original homeworld of Korriban as well as cultivated an intensely xenophobic society. 

### Names
Sith pureblood names are not conventional. They are often named for virtues in the Sith tongue. Sith rarely share surnames, since they do not value family ties. When a sith pureblood achieves a success or victory, they often change their name to match their perceived newfound status. Since Force-sensitivity is common in sith purebloods, and their culture is built around strength, most sith are called simply "My Lord," or some other epithet, by their underlings.

**Male Names.** Aqorzum, Khashai, Sihmot, Wirjol

**Female Names.** Aqurwia, Cliriu, Nupax, Ubhesosiuth

### Sith Pureblood Traits
As a sith pureblood, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Sith reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** The cruelty of the Sith causes them to tend toward chaotic dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Sith generally stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh less than 200 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Force-Sensitive.*** You know the *denounce* at-will force power. When you reach 3rd level, you learn and can cast the *curse* force power once per long rest. When you reach 5th level, you learn and can cast the *bestow curse* force power once per long rest. Your forcecasting ability is Charisma for these powers.

***Keen Senses.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

***Menacing.*** You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Sith. Sith is an agglutinative language, in which words or even phrases were made up of linears sequences of distinct meaningful units.

<div style='margin-top:49px'></div>

### Biology and Appearence
Togruta have rusty skin tones ranging in hue from blue to red to green, with white pigmentation on their faces, greyish lips, and white stripes adorn various parts of their bodies. The pattern of stripes varies from individual to individual. This red and white pattern was a phenotype left over from their ancestor's camouflage that helped them to blend in with Shili's natural surroundings.

Their heads bear two montrals, with three to four head-tails, whose stripes were darker than those of the montrals. Togruta have the ability to sense the proximity and movement of physical objects around them by means of their hollow montrals, which detect space ultrasonically. Young togrutas' montrals and posterior head-tail do not fully grow until adolescence, when their montrals curve and their final head-tail grows to the length of their other head-tails.

### Society and Culture
Togruta have a strong sense of unity and togetherness. On their native homeworld of Shili, they rely on each other and  band together to take a stand against the massive monsters that hunt them. The creatures of Shili most often attack in groups, which was even more reason for the native togruta to work together. While most of Shili is covered in the scrublands where the togruta hunt their herbivorous prey, the togruta live in small communities in the forest valleys.

### Names
Togruta names are typically long. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Acanaar, Mukraas, Obolak, Tokrym

**Female Names.** Akoma, Maasha, Okohlo, Shola

**Surnames.** Hyl, Na, Nim, Ris, Resh, Vaal, Zin

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Togruta reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Togruta culture focuses on unity which causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Togruta typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh 150 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Mask of the Wild.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.

***Montral Reception.*** You have tremorsense out to 30 feet. You can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that you and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures.

***Wild Hunters.*** You have proficiency in the Survival skill.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Togruti. Togruti is an ornate language characterized by trills and long vowel sounds which are modified by subtle tremors in the togruta’s head-tails. This language is heavily influenced by Basic, but also incorporates some native idioms, which cause Basic-speaking togruta to use seemingly strange expressions.

<div style='margin-top:48px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Trandoshans are a large, bipedal sentient species, with scaly skin which was shed roughly once every standard year and was thought to be very durable. Cold-blooded reptiles, trandoshans had two super-sensitive varied color eyes with horizontal black pupils, which could see far into the infrared range. Each of their four limbs ends in three razor sharp claws. These are perfect for combat, but did not grant them manual dexterity, making a trandoshan's finger movements somewhat clumsy and awkward. 

### Society and Culture
Trandoshans worship their goddess, the Scorekeeper, whom they would appease through acts which increased their Jagannath points. This is done by living a lifestyle which was, by non-trandoshan standards, overtly aggressive, leading many trandoshans to become bounty hunters, mercenaries, or slavers. Trandoshans especially prize wookiee pelts, which consequently play a large part in earning Jagannath points-capturing the pelts of particularly infamous wookiees would give the hunter a large increase in Jagganath points. To be shamed or captured during a hunt would zero one's Jagganath points-effectively making their life forfeit in the eyes of the Scorekeeper. They could, however, win all those points back by killing the one who zeroed their score.

### Names
Trandoshan names are quite harsh and contain a lot of elongated sounds, as well as a lot of s's. Differences between male and female names are often very subtle, but there is a higher chance for female names to contain softer sounds.

**Male Names.** Bossk, Tshyrrng, Varrsk, Wuikkekss

**Female Names.** Aksa, Idwiks, Kluks, Mezuus, Shokss

**Surnames.** Dallosss, Druc, Groqisch, Hsac, Nausdot

### Trandoshan Traits
As a trandoshan, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Trandoshans reach adulthood in their early teens and rarely live to be older than 70.

***Alignment.*** Trandoshans tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Trandoshans stand as tall as 7 and a half feet and can weigh over 300 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Claws.*** Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage.

***Darkvision.*** Your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. 

***Regenerative.*** When you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend a Hit Die to regain hit points as long as the damage would not reduce your hit points to 0.

***Saving Face.*** Trandoshans are careful not to show weakness in front of their allies, for fear of losing status. If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Dosh. Dosh is characterized by its harsh grunts, hisses and growls, and its written form that used alphabetic glyphs.

<div style='margin-top:106px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
While Tuskens, also known as Tusken Raiders or Sand People, are easily recognizable by their full-body clothing, goggles, and mouth filters, little of their true physical appearance can be discerned. From birth, Tuskens are covered in wraps, and, barring very rare occasions, will not bare any part of their skin in sight of another person. This, combined with their hostility to outsiders and Tatooine's remote and arid nature, makes even study of Tusken corpses difficult.

### Society and Culture
Tuskens are a primative, tribal race, mostly living in small clans scattered throughout Tatooine's deserts. Due to the harsh and unforgiving desert environment, Tusken clans are often xenophobic and territorial, but it is not unknown for them to adopt members of other species into the clan. They believe that all water is sacred and promised to them alone, and are infamous among the other residents of Tatooine for raiding and pillaging settlements and farms.

Tusken clans are usually very stratified, with males as hunters and warriors, while females and children maintain the camp. Tusken warriors hold their bond with their gaderffii weapons and Bantha mounts as sacred, and will choose death before relinquishing either.

### Names
Tusken naming traditions vary between clans, but most are made up of harsh, guttural sounds. Tuskens do not use surnames.

**Male Names.** Ur Ur, A'Koba, Qeruru'rr, Gr'Karr

**Female Names.** K'Yark, Reirin, K'Orou, Ursarr'u

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:265px'></div>

### Tusken Traits
As a Tusken, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength or Charisma score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Tuskens are considered adults when they turn 15. Because of the harsh and unforgiving climate of their home world, they rarely live longer than half a century.

***Alignment.*** Tusken culture's violent focus and disregard of those outside the tribe causes them to tend towards chaotic dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Tusken stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh around 155 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.

***Animal Handler.*** You have proficiency in the Animal Handling skill.

***Desert Protection.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being blinded.

***Fearsome Roar.*** Once per day, you can cast the *fear* force power. Charisma is your forcecasting ability for this power.

***Survivors of the Sands.*** You have proficiency in the Survival skill. Additionally, you don’t treat desert terrain as difficult terrain. Lastly, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion due to extreme heat.

***Tech-Impaired.*** While tuskens can figure out basic technology, they experience difficulty using more complex equipment like wristpads. You can not use tech powers or take levels in techcasting classes.

***Tusken Weaponry.*** You have proficiency with the cycler rifle and vibroaxe.

***Languages.*** You can speak Tusken, and speak, read, and write Galactic Basic. Tusken is a guttural language characterized by its barks, growls, and roars. While Tuskens typically understand Galactic Basic, it is rare to hear them speak anything but Tusken. Tusken has no written form. Tuskens also know a complex sign language used to communicate with other tuskens silently.

<div style='margin-top:50px'></div>

### Biology and Appearence
Twi'leks are usually thin, although corpulent individuals were known to exist. Twi'leks are omnivores; this diet is essential given that food is scarce on their homeworld, Ryloth. Twi'leks possess multiple stomachs, an unusual trait that enables them to eat almost any food. When traveling off their homeworld, twi'leks rarely refuse food, which frequently leads to obesity among starfarers. Twi'lek society also considers obesity as a sign of influence and success.

### Society and Culture
The natural grace and exotic beauty of the female twi'leks make them a popular target among slave traders. Slavery is the main currency of Ryloth. Some see it as a chance to make money by kidnapping or selling orphaned children, while others see slavery as a way of saving children from growing up in Ryloth's harsh environment. A number of twi'leks believe that slavery is an efficient way to proliferate their species and preserve their culture, as the twi'leks lack their own means of inter-planetary travel. Regardless of how it came about, many twi'leks live as slaves or entertainers and are considered status symbols, especially the females of rarer skin hues. Twi'leks that manage to escape from captivity usually turned to a life of thievery or prostitution, with both genders making use of their powers of seduction.

### Names
Twi'lek names combine their first name and a clan name into a single name, rather than having a separate surname.

**Male Names.** Ecrizsati, Gaj'mogos, Ukelweko

**Female Names.** Arag'mure, Oanicfuba, Unaecripi

### Biology and Appearance
Weequays are humanoids with thick, leathery skin that ranges in color from tan to dark brown. Their faces are lipless, with a frill along each of their jowls.

### Society and Culture
Weequays have the ability to communicate with members of their own clan through smell by exuding complex pheromones. This pheromonal language can not be understood by any other species, or even by Weequays of another clan. Only Jedi senses can even tell that two Weequay are communicating. Since each Weequay's pheromones are unique, Weequay have no need for a name within their clan. As a result, speech is only a secondary form of communication for Weequay, and they seldom speak a whole sentence, resulting in Humans mistakenly believing the species to be unintelligent.

Male Weequay often tie their hair into a long braid each year spent away from their homeworld as a tribute to their home. When they returned, they shaved their braids. Weequays serving the Hutts were often very close to their homeworld, and would only have one or two braids. Female Weequay were usually bald, and did not follow this tradition.

### Names
Only Weequay who have to live among other clans, or among non-Weequay, take a personal name. Even then, some are simply referred to as "Weequay". In Weequay culture, individual identity is much less important than the clan. As long as the clan survives, a single Weequay is expendable. This results in a sometimes brutal culture.

**Male Names.** Chublu, Fah, Kreakk, Og-Rollo, Yurrenn

**Female Names.** Gila, Qommi, Palsa, Sex, Xelror

**Surnames.** Britreg, Dlur, Klanz, Maub, Semu

### Biology and Appearance
Wookiees are a tall species of furry giants from the planet Kashyyyk, who can grow to a height of over eight feet. They are covered from head to toe in a thick, shaggy coat of hair with water-shedding properties that notably came in shades of brown, black, gray, and white. The species has two sexes, female and male. The latter grows long beards in adult life. Wookiee eye colors are usually blue, green, yellow, golden, brown, or red.

### Society and Culture
Wookiees greatly value honor and loyalty. Therefore, their notion of "family" encompassed much more than just blood ties. A part of that most sacred tradition was the social institution of life debt: when a wookiee's life was saved by someone else, regardless of the species, they would frequently devote themselves to a lifetime of service to their savior and their family. Through the mechanism of the life debt, the People of the Trees used to develop unbreakable bonds with their boon companions and true friends, forming a "honor family."

### Names
Wookiee names are diverse; some names are simple and short while others are long and complicated. The majority of names often have softer big sounds and more melodic tones to them. Since offworlders have trouble using wookiees' real names, they often adopt simpler nicknames to go by.

**Male Names.** Fubbodrrl, Gurrfupayyc, Kioerrr, Lavgaeffoak, Snrowbishutchuh, Zufiaarkaykkk

**Female Names.** Bulabba, Bonbaegnh, Hopakleupo, Keumnebheu, Onninh, Osstatiemmyock

<div style='margin-top:48px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Zabrak are near-human, but have a number of significant physical characteristics that set them apart from baseline Humanity. The most striking of these are a series of vestigial horns that crown the heads of both males and females. These horns grow at puberty in varying patterns and signified that their rite of passage is drawing near.

In addition to their horns, another of the traits that make zabrak instantly recognizable are their facial tattoos, which are made up of thin lines received during their rite of passage. These could symbolize many things, including but not limited to family lineage, place of birth, or even a design that reflected their individual personalities.

Lastly, zabraks possess a second heart.

### Society and Culture
Zabrak are often seen by most other species as being single-minded, an observation that is not terribly incorrect. This single-minded determination comes from the fact that they are a species with a strong sense of self-assuredness, confident that they are able to accomplish any task that they set out to do. However, this does not lead a zabrak to develop a sense of prideful superiority towards others. Though it is not uncommon to see competition between colonies, this is not seen as a negative. The zabraks believe that the various experiences of the different colonies only serve to add to the species' overall value throughout the galaxy.

### Names
Zabrak names are usually derived from the animals living on their planet. Zabraks don't use surnames.

**Male Names.** Kadro, Muraa, Neqama, Ruvroo, Xadra

**Female Names.** Blostopa, Mega, Novrar, Rebroke
