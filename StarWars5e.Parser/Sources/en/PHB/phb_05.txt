<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:29px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">he marketplace of a large city teems with buyers and</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sellers of many sorts: Jawas peddling refurbished wares (or trying to steal from careless travelers), Ugnauts selling various technology scrap, Twi'lek armstechs and Mirialan synthweavers. In the largest cities, almost anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to speeders and spaceships.		

For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount importance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death in a stronghold or the untamed wilds. This chapter details the mundane and exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the face of the threats that the worlds of D&D present.

## Wealth
Wealth generally appears in the form of credits. The Galactic Republic and Sith Empire have their own mints, but in most worlds, the chits are interchangeable. Other trade goods, gemstones, artifacts, and property can reflect your character's financial well-being. Members of the lower class trade in goods, bartering for what they need and paying taxes in raw materials. Members of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such as the rights to a mine, a port, or a company, or in high denomination credits. Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering professional services for hire commonly deal in credits.

### Currency
Credits come in a variety of denominations: from a single chit to cards loaded with incredible value. While the Republic and Empire have their own currencies, in most worlds they can be used interchangeably.
 
With ten credits, a character can buy a power cell, a stylus, or a glowrod. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn ten credits a day. The credit is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the chit itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of credits, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual chits. Rather, the credit is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in credit cards, letters of credit, or valuable goods.			
 
A standard chit weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty chits weigh a pound.	

\columnbreak

### Selling Treasure										
Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.

#### Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment
As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Used weapons and armor aren't always in good enough condition to sell.										
    
#### Enhanced Items
Selling enhanced items can be problematic. Finding someone to find an overtuned blaster isn't hard, but the most unique of items are beyond all but the wealthiest denizens. Likewise, aside from a few common enhanced items, you won't normally come across enhanced items to purchase. The value of special equipment is far beyond simple credits and should always be treated as such.

#### Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects
These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for credits or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large city or even another planet.

#### Trade Goods
In the Outer Rim, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods—raw materials like bags of salt, livestock, and so on—retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.

### At Higher Levels
As characters progress to higher levels, there is an expectation of increased wealth, be it in the shape of coin or equipment. The below table serves as a target for how much each character should have earned at certain levels.

## Armor and Shields
The different worlds of *Star Wars* are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from basic combat suits to heavy battle armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in the worlds of *Star Wars*.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Armor and Shield Proficiency
Anyone can put on a suit of armor or wield a shield. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor or wield a shield that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't force- or tech-cast.

If you have proficiency in armor, you have proficiency in the appropriate shield as well.

> #### Variant: Equipment Sizes
> In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common sense. For example, a burly wookiee won't fit in a jawa's combat suit, and an ugnaught would be swallowed up in a gamorrean's hooded cloak. 
>
> The GM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of armor made for one human might not fit another one without significant alterations, and a guard's uniform might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise.
>
> Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit an armormech, synthweaver, or similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. The GM can either roll 1d4x10 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent of the alterations required.

### Armor Class (AC)
Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your armor class (AC).

### Armor Properties
Many armors and shield have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Armor table.

#### Bulky
While wearing armor with this property, you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on sound.

#### Obtrusive
While wielding a shield with this property, you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on sight.

#### Strength
While wearing armor or wielding a shield with this property, your speed is reduced by 10 unless your Strength score meets or exceeds the strength number.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 5 | EQUIPMENT</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Light Armor
Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

#### Combat Suit
Combat suits are seen all over the galaxy, and can be found for sale by almost any merchant who dealt in weapons and armor. Many such suits are used by military organizations, such as the Galactic Republic's military, as well as by mercenaries, criminals, bounty hunters and even some Jedi.

The suit itself offers decent protection from most types of attacks while maintaining maximum flexibility and minimum weight. However this armor is only recommended for light skirmishes.

#### Fiber Armor
Fiber armor is a type of armor that offers more protection than the lighter combat suit. Fiber armor is heavier overall than combat suits, and not quite as flexible, but many consider the trade-offs worthwhile. It is a good source of defense from physical attacks and light blaster fire.

### Medium Armor
Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

#### Mesh armor
Providing solid protection for a minimal cost, mesh armor is considered excellent protection for entrenched troops or guards. However, this protection comes at a cost of mobility, limiting its uses by rapidly advancing infantry. Still, it provides more mobility than battle armor.

#### Weave Armor
Weave armor was constructed<br> from a mesh of metal or<br> composite plates and a<br> padded jumpsuit. Variants<br> of the armor included less<br> plates and more padding for<br> a lighter, though less protect-<br>ive armor, and heavier plating<br> with molded pieces to fit the<br> wearer. Though the armor was<br> available unmodified, most users<br> personalized their armor.

#### Composite Armor
Composite armor is a type of armored suit that offers a good balance of mobility and protection against most types of weapons. The micro-hydraulics of this type of powered armor provide the operator with protection, but are more bulky than mesh or weave armors. This type of armor is rarely seen outside of professional mercenaries' and soldiers' use.

\columnbreak

### Heavy Armor
Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk. Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

#### Battle Armor
Battle armor is an armor that reduced weight, but restricts movement. The armor is commonly used by mercenaries, bounty hunters, soldiers, and civilians that live in dangerous areas.

#### Assault Armor
Assault armor improved on battle armor, with the benefit of micro-hydraulics that boost the efficacy of the operator. It offers better protection, but increased weight.

#### Heavy Exoskeleton
Heavy exoskeletons are virtually the heaviest armor acquirable during the Galactic War. It is ideal for extreme combat situations that involved direct damage and also offers a very good level of protection in sacrifice of dexterity. Some consider it claustrophobic but that was the trade-off for safety.

### Shields
Shields come in varying weights, sizes, and materials. Light shields are smaller and mounted to the forearm, while medium and heavy shields are held in hand. You can only benefit from one shield at a time.

***Physical Shields.*** Physical shields are made entirely of physical materials. They are cheaper than their generator counterparts, but heavier. 

***Shield Generators.*** Shield generators are made almost entirely of energy barriers. Medium and heavy shield generators have a physical handheld component from which the barrier emanates; medium shield generators are orbs that are slightly larger than a fist, while heavy shield generators project from a large cross.

#### Light Shields
A light shield is generally affixed to the forearm. While a light shield does not fill the hand, you gain no benefit from it while the hand is full. You gain no benefit from a light shield while wielding a weapon with the heavy property.

#### Medium Shields
A medium shield is a common defensive technology that protects the user from blaster fire, the elements, or other hazards. Medium shields are used in conjunction with any one-handed weapon.

#### Heavy Shields
Heavy shields are much larger and more cumbersome, but they offer more protection than their smaller counterparts. Their unwieldy size, however, requires the use of a one-handed weapon with the light property in the other hand.

### Getting Into and Out of Armor
The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category. If you have help, you can reduce the time it takes to don or doff armor by half.

***Don.*** This is the time it takes to<br> put on armor or wield your shield.<br> You benefit from the armor only<br> if you take the full time to don<br> the suit of armor.

***Doff.*** This is the time it<br> takes to remove armor or<br> store your shield.

## Weapons
Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a vibroweapon or a blaster, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring. The Weapons tables show the most common weapons used in the worlds of *Star Wars*, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as a blaster, lightweapon, or vibroweapon. A vibroweapon or lightweapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a blaster is used to attack a target at a distance. Lightweapons are generally used in melee, but due to their nature require separate proficiency.

### Weapon Proficiency
Your species, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are simple and martial. Most people can use simple weapons, which are commonly seen in the hands of the unspecialized, with proficiency. Martial weapons, such as vibroswords or sniper rifles, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use. Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

### Improvised Weapons
Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is close at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead jawa.

In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. At the GM's discretion, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 kinetic damage. If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

### Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

#### Auto
Weapons with this property can only fire in burst, penetrating, or rapid modes. If the weapon has any combination of burst, penetrating, and rapid modes, you choose which mode to use. You can only use one mode at a time.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

#### Burst
When you would make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead spray a 10-foot-cube area within range with shots, consuming ammunition equal to the burst number. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon) or take the weapon's normal damage. Before you use this property, you can declare one creature that would be affected by it. If the creature fails its save, in addition to the weapon's normal damage, it is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit. If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw.

#### Dexterity
A weapon with this property requires more skill to control. While wielding it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Dexterity requirement. 

#### Disguised
You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to hide the nature of a weapon with this property.

#### Double
A weapon with this property can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with Double-Weapon Fighting. See the rules for Double-Weapon Fighting in chapter 9.

#### Finesse
When making an attack with a weapon with this property, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

#### Fixed
A weapon with this property does not fill the hand, but you can't use the weapon while the hand is full. Additionally, you have a +10 bonus to ability checks and saving throws to avoid being disarmed of this weapon.

#### Heavy
When you hit with an attack roll using Strength with a weapon with this property, you deal additional damage equal to half your Strength modifier (minimum of +1).

#### Hidden
You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal a weapon with this property.

#### Interlocking
While wielding a weapon with the interlocking property, you can use your object interaction to detach the weapon into two separate weapons or reattach into a single weapon. While separated, each weapon has the same damage, damage type, combined value and weight, and properties (except for the double property) as the single weapon.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 5 | EQUIPMENT</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Light
A weapon with this property is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when engaging in Double- or Two-Weapon Fighting. See the rules for Double- and Two-Weapon Fighting in chapter 9.

#### Luminous
A weapon with this property sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius while activated. Additionally, Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while the weapon is activated have disadvantage.

#### Penetrating 
When you would make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead attempt to penetrate and hit a creature behind the target, consuming ammunition equal to the penetrating number. Make an attack roll against the initial target. If the attack hits, there is a creature within 15 feet of that creature and directly behind it, and the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it also takes normal weapon damage. Alternatively, you can use this property to fire at a creature through partial cover. When you do so, you reduce the target's cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to one-quarter), rather than targeting a second creature.

#### Power Cell
Weapons with this property are fueled by power cells, which must be loaded in order to fire the weapon. A power cell fuels a number of attacks equal to the weapon's reload number.

#### Range
A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has this property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

#### Rapid
When you would make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead unload on a single target, consuming ammunition equal to the rapid number. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon). On a failed save, roll the weapon's damage dice twice and add them together, adding relevant modifiers as normal and subjecting the target to any additional effects that would occur on a hit. If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw.

#### Reach
A weapon with this property adds 5 feet to your reach with it.

#### Reload
A number of shots equal to the reload number can be made with a weapon with this property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (their choice). You must have one free hand to reload.

\columnbreak

#### Returning 
When you throw a weapon with this property, it automatically returns to your hand after the attack is complete, whether you hit or miss.

#### Slug Cartridge
Weapons with this property fire slug cartridges, which must be loaded in order to fire the weapon.

#### Special
A weapon with this property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see "Special Weapons" later in this section).

#### Strength
A weapon with this property has a heavy kickback. While wielding it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Strength requirement. If the weapon has the burst, penetrating, or rapid property, you must meet the Strength requirement to use this feature. If the weapon lacks the two-handed property, you can wield the weapon in two hands to temporarily reduce the strength number by one step (from 19 to 17, 17 to 15, 15 to 13, or 13 to 11). If this would reduce the strength number below 11, you ignore it entirely.

#### Thrown
Weapons with this property can be thrown to make a ranged attack. If the weapon would normally be used to make melee weapon attacks, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. 

#### Two-Handed
A weapon with this property requires two hands to use.

#### Versatile
A weapon with this property can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.	

### Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described below.

#### Net
A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on formless or Huge or larger creatures. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has an AC of 10, 5 hit points, and immunity to all damage not dealt by melee weapons. Destroying the net frees the creature without harming it and immediately ends the net's effects. While a creature is restrained by a net, you can make no further attacks with it.

#### Vibrodart
Due to their diminutive size, vibrodarts make ineffective melee weapons. Melee attack rolls made with them are made at disadvantage.

#### Wrist Launcher
Rather than traditional power cells, the wrist launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of darts, small missiles, or specialized canisters.

</div>	

#### Missile, Fragmentation
This wrist launcher ammunition deals 1d6 kinetic damage on a hit. Additionally, hit or miss, the missile then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d10 kinetic damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.

#### Power Cell
Power cells fuel blaster weapons that deal energy or ion damage. Additionally, power cells are used to energize certain tools.

#### Projector Canister, Cryo
When triggered, this wrist launcher ammunition produces a beam of carbonite energy in a line 15 feet long and 5 feet wide or a 15-foot cone. A single fuel canister holds enough fuel for three attacks in a line or a single attack in a cone. Each creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d4 cold damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't slowed. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, that creature is frozen in carbonite for 1 hour. If you lack proficiency in the wrist launcher, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.

#### Projector Canister, Incendiary
When triggered, this wrist launcher ammunition produces a burst of flame in a line 15 feet long and 5 feet wide or a 15-foot cone. A single fuel canister holds enough fuel for three attacks in a line or a single attack in a cone. Each creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d8 fire damage or half as much on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. If you lack proficiency in the wrist launcher, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.

#### Slug Cartridge
Slug cartridges are ammunition for blaster weapons that deal kinetic damage. When you reload a weapon that uses cartridges, you can reload any number of cartridges up to the weapon's reload number as a part of the same action.

### Communications
#### Commlink
commlinks are simple handheld communication devices, fitted with microphones and receivers. Basic, personal commlinks have a range of up to 30 miles, but are reduced in dense, urban areas or areas of high level interference. The commlink lasts for 10 hours and can be recharged by connecting to a power source or by replacing the power cell.

#### Comm Jammer
A device used to scramble and block transmissions from communications devices in a 300 foot radius. The device can be activated or deactivated as an action. Any creature sending incoming or outgoing communications within range must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. On a failure, their communications are jammed until the comm jammer is deactivated or they move out of its range. The comm jammer lasts for 1 hour and can be recharged by connecting to a power source or by replacing the power cell.

#### Commlink, Hands-Free
A hands-free commlink functions as a commlink, but can be installed in a helmet or worn independently, such as on your head or ear.

#### Holocomm
A holocomm is a communications unit that utilizes the HoloNet. It enables users to send and receive messages through holographic-based transmission networks.

#### Holotrace Device
A holotrace device is a wrist-worn gadget that can be used to trace a holographic transmission back to its source.

#### Pocket Scrambler
A pocket scrambler is a simple add-on to any commlink that automatically encodes any messages sent out. The transmitted message can only be read by a device equipped with a matched scrambler.

### Data Recording and Storage	
#### Code Cylinder
Code cylinders are security devices in the shape of short cylinders that contain coded information about their bearers and grant them access to secure areas.

#### Datacard
A datacard or data disk is a flat, hand-held device used in conjunction with a datapad to store information.

#### Datacron   
A datacron is a type of holocron that can be accessed by non-Force-sensitives and are mainly used to store encrypted data. They are complete with an interactive projection to access the information.

#### Datapad
A datapad is a small electronic device used for the input, storage and displaying of information. It features a holoprojective surface for 3D viewing.

### Explosives
#### Grenade, Fragmentation
Grenades can be set to detonate on impact or with a timer that causes them to explode on initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties). As an action, you can prime and throw a grenade at a point you can see within 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one.

#### Grenade, Gas
Grenades can be set to detonate on impact or with a timer that causes them to explode on initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties). As an action, you can prime and throw a grenade at a point you can see within 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. The grenade explodes, filling the air in a 10-foot-radius sphere with yellow-green fog for 1 minute. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses it.

When a creature enters the fog or starts its turn there, it creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is poisoned while it is in the cloud. Droids, constructs and humanoids wearing appropriate protective equipment are unaffected.

#### Grenade, Ion
Grenades can be set to detonate on impact or with a timer that causes them to explode on initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties). As an action, you can prime and throw a grenade at a point you can see within 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 ion damage on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. Any electronics within the blast radius are disabled until rebooted. 

#### Grenade, Plasma
Grenades can be set to detonate on impact or with a timer that causes them to explode on initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties). As an action, you can prime and throw a grenade at a point you can see within 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 energy damage on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one.

#### Mine, Fragmentation
Mines can be set to detonate when a creature comes within up to 15 feet of it or paired with a remote detonator. As an action, you can prime and set a mine on a surface you can reach, which arms at the start of your next turn. When detonated, each creature within 15 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one.

detonator. As an action, you<br> can prime and set a mine on<br> a surface you can reach, which<br> arms at the start of your next turn.<br> When detonated, the mine fills the<br> air in a 15-foot-radius sphere with yellow-green fog for 1 minute. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses it.

When a creature enters the fog or starts its turn there, it creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is poisoned while it is in the cloud. Droids, constructs and humanoids wearing appropriate protective equipment are unaffected.

#### Mine, Incendiary
Mines can be set to detonate when a creature comes within up to 15 feet of it or paired with a remote detonator. As an action, you can prime and set a mine on a surface you can reach, which arms at the start of your next turn. When detonated, the mine sets the ground in a 15-foot radius ablaze for 1 minute. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

When a creature enters the fire or starts its turn there, it creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

#### Thermal Detonator
Thermal detonators are unique in that can only be turned off by whoever turned them on. They can be set to detonate on impact or with a timer that causes them to explode on initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties). As an action, you can prime and throw a grenade at a point you can see within 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. Each creature within 20 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire and 2d10 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

#### Medpac
A medpac is a quick-acting syringe filled with a concentrated dose of kolto. As an action, you can use this medpac to restore hit points to a beast or humanoid within 5 feet. The creature rolls one die equal to the size of their Hit Die and regains hit points equal to the amount rolled + their Constitution modifier (minimum of one hit point). If the creature has Hit Dice of different sizes, use whichever Hit Die size they have the most of.

#### Poison
As an action, you can use the poison in this vial to coat one vibroweapon, one slug cartridge, or one wrist launcher dart. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d4 poison damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.

### Utilities

#### Binders
Binders can be used to restrain a Small or Medium creature with appropriate appendages. Applying binders takes an action, and the target must make a DC 14 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (the target chooses the ability to use). A hostile creature makes this save with advantage. Breaking the binders requires a DC 20 Strength check. Escaping them requires a DC 20 Dexterity check. A set of binders comes with one key. Without the key, unlocking the binders requires a DC 15 security kit to force open. Binders have an AC of 10 and 15 hit points. Destroying the binders frees the creature without harming it.

#### Chronometer
A chronometer is a device that measures and keeps linear time.

#### Field Rations (One day's)
Ration packs consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, and are used when other food is scarce. Each pack is divided into portions and can provide enough food for one person per day.

#### Fusion Cutter
A fusion cutter is a handheld cutting tool popular among technicians. It can cut through almost any reinforced material, given enough time. The internal power cell supplies an hour's worth of continuous operation.

#### Glowrod
Glowrods create a beam of light illuminating the area around you in bright light for a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The glowrod lasts for 10 hours and can be recharged by connecting to a power source or by replacing the power cell. 

#### Grappling Hook
A grappling hook allows a user to climb or ascend large objects. It can be mounted to a blaster, belt, or elsewhere. It has a 50-foot length.

#### Heat Generator
Heat generators are special devices typically worn on belts that function as a portable, personal heat supply. Activating or deactivating the generator requires a bonus action and, while active, you are adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The generator lasts for 10 minutes and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cell.

#### Homing Beacon
A homing beacon is a device used to track starships or any other entity being transported. Homing beacons transmit using non-mass HoloNet transceivers able to be tracked through hyperspace. Homing beacons are small enough that they can easily be hidden inside a ship, or tucked into some crevice on its exterior.

#### Macrobinoculars
Macrobinoculars are handheld viewing devices that allow users to observe distant objects. Some models are able to see into space from the surface of a planet.

#### Mess Kit
This box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.

#### Ram, Portable
You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.

#### Restraining Bolt
Restraining bolts are small, cylindrical devices that can be affixed to a droid in order to limit its functions and enforce its obedience. When inserted, a restraining bolt restricts the droid from any movement its master does not desire, and also forced it to respond to signals produced by a hand-held control unit. 

Installing a restraining bolt takes 1 minute. The droid must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. A hostile droid makes this save with advantage. On a successful save, the restraining bolt overloads and is rendered useless. On a failed save, the restraining bolt is correctly installed, and the control unit can be used to actively control the droid. While the control unit is inactive, the droid can act freely but it can not attempt to remove the restraining bolt.

## Tools
A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, pick a lock, or slice into a computer. Your species, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. Like skills, proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it. Unlike skills, you must have your tools present in order to make an ability check with them. 

The table shows examples of some of the most common types of tools. Each tool falls under one of four categories: artisan's implements, gaming sets, musical instruments, or specialist's kits. Each tool requires a separate proficiency. 

#### Artisan's Implements
Artisan's implements are predominantly designed for building and crafting things of permanent nature. Each set of implements focuses on a specific craft. 

***Armormech's Implements.*** Armormech's implements are for crafting and repairing armor and shields.

***Armstech's Implements.*** Armstech's implements are for crafting and repairing blasters and vibroweapons.

***Artificer's Implements.*** Artificer's implements are for creating lightweapons.

***Astrotech's Implements.*** Astrotech's implements are for crafting and modifying droids.

***Biotech's Implements.*** Biotech's implements are used to create cybernetic augmentations.

***Cybertech's Implements.*** Cybertech's implements are used for crafting and modifying wristpads.

***Gadgeteer's Implements.*** Gadgeteer's implements are used for crafting many types of adventuring gear, such as jet packs or friction-grip gear.

***Tinker's Implements.*** Tinker's implements are general use tools that can craft small and versatile trinkets.

#### Gaming Sets
This item encompasses a wide range of game pieces, including dice and/or decks of cards. A few common examples appear on the Tools table, but other kinds of gaming sets exist. 

#### Musical Instruments
Several of the most common types of musical instruments are shown on the table as examples. Musical instruments can often be used in place of—or in addition to—a performance.

#### Specialist's Kits
Like artisan's implements, specialist's kits are need to pursue a craft or trade. Some specialist's kits are used to craft items that are impermanent, such as grenades, medpacs, or poisons while other tools are used to achieve a specific purpose, such as picking locks or creating a disguise.

***Biochemist's Kit.*** Biochemist's kits are used to create and enhance medpacs and other healing implements.

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

&emsp;***Chef's Kit.*** Chef's kits are used to prepare food and identify food that might be spoiled or tampered with.

***Demolitions Kit.*** Demolitions kits are used to create, enhance, and disarm explosives.

***Disguise Kit.*** Disguise kits are used to modify a creature's appearance, to hide their appearance or to mimic the appearance of others.

***Forgery Kit.*** Forgery kits create false document and certifications, both physical and digital.

***Mechanic's Kit.*** Mechanic's kits are used to craft and repair vehicles and starships.

***Poisoner's Kit.*** Poisoner's kits are designed to create and identify poisons.

***Security Kit.*** Security kits are used to bypass physical locks.

***Slicer's Kit.*** Slicer's kits can bypass computerized defenses and locks.

***Trapper's Kit.*** Trapper's kits can create, disarm, and disassemble traps.

## Expenses					
When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.

### Lifestyle Expenses					
Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.

At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character's career.

Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.

##### Lifestyle Expenses					
|	Lifestyle		|	Price/Day	|
|	:--		|	--:	|
|	Wretched		|	—	|
|	Squalid		|	1 cr	|
|	Poor		|	2 cr	|
|	Modest		|	10 cr	|
|	Comfortable		|	20 cr	|
|	Wealthy		|	40 cr	|
|	Aristocratic		|	at least 100 cr 	|

#### Wretched
You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.

#### Squalid
You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div> 

misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed diseased.

#### Poor
A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a cantina. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.

#### Modest
A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, and the like.

#### Comfortable
Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small domicile in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine establishment. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.

#### Wealthy
Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.

#### Aristocratic
You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of the affluent. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.

### Food, Drink, and Lodging					
The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night's lodging. These prices are included in your total lifestyle expenses.

> ##### Self-Sufficiency
> The expenses and lifestyles described in this chapter assume that you are spending your time between adventures in cities, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford— paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to repair your equipment, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.
> 
> Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, as described in chapter 8, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.

### Services
Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.

Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a fighter might commission an armstech to craft a special vibroblade, while a scholar might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming meeting with a senator. 

Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a trandoshan army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the facilities clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.
