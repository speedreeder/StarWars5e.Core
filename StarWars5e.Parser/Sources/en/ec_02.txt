<div style='margin-top:69px;'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The hulking abyssin have long limbs and a single large eye that dominates their foreheads. Typically well-muscled, the abyssin's stooping gait results in a slightly hunched appearance. 

A distinctive trait of the abyssin is their ability to heal quickly; their fast regeneration is believed to have been an adaptation to prevent fluid loss via bleeding on their desert homeworld. All cells in the abyssin body are replaced every 80 hours, and organs which typically were paired in other species appear singularly.

### Society and Culture
A primitive tribal society, the abyssin of Byss are known as violent and brutish, and their planet is avoided by most beings in the civilized galaxy. Unstable resources on Byss do not allow for mass population growth or for the stabilization of a central government, economy or trade system. 

Existing simply in nomadic tribes, abyssin groups can interact peacefully with one another, though only if both groups have plentiful water and food supplies. Otherwise, they began a 'Blooding', a brawl that ends only when one tribe's warriors are all killed, captured, or incapacitated. Warriors who survive a Blooding are usually allowed to join the winning tribe once they finish their regeneration. This tradition led to some violent incidents when spacers tried to make first contact and trade with Abyssin tribes with scarce water resources, especially since the abyssin assumed the alien traders could regenerate as quickly as they did. 

### Names
There does not appear to be any distinction between male and female names for abyssin. Abyssin don't use surnames.

**Names.** Anami, Easym, Myo, Qawohl, Seh-run, Sidie

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:401px'></div>

### Abyssin Traits
As an abyssin, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Abyssin reach adulthood at age 30 and can live up to 300 years thanks to their regenerative abilities.

***Alignment.*** Abyssin's violent and anarchic upbringing cause them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Abyssin stand around 6 feet tall and weigh between 200 and 400 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Rapidly Regenerative.*** You heal quickly, both at will and in response to danger. As a bonus action, you can choose to spend one of your Hit Dice to recover hit points. Additionally, when you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend a Hit Die to regain hit points as long as the damage would not reduce your hit points to 0.

***Rugged Survivalist.*** You are proficient in the Survival skill. Additionally, you are naturally adapted to hot climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

***Tech-Impaired.*** While abyssin can figure out basic technology, they experience difficulty using more complex equipment like wristpads. You can not use tech powers or take levels in techcasting classes.

***Savage Attacks.*** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Abyssin. Abyssin uses mainly growls and grunts that many species consider primitive. The written form of language uses only a small number of simple hieroglyphs.

<div style='margin-top:40px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Advozsec evolved from herbivorous reptile-analogs which fed on the vegetation known to form around Riflor's hot springs. Evolving into a class of reptomammal, advozsec have a single horn at the crown of their heads, four digits on each hand and foot, pointed ears, and large eyes. Advozsec are strictly vegetarian, unable to properly digest meat. The geothermal hot springs that appear on their homeworld forced the species to evolve thick skin in order to survive. The large eyes of the advozsec are adaptations to the clouds of volcanic ash which darken Riflor's skies. 

### Society and Culture
Since so much of the sunlight on Riflor is blocked by volcanic eruptions, advozsec tend to settle near geothermal springs for heat. Unfortunately, these springs also tend to be in geologically unstable regions, and anything built near them is often destroyed or abandoned due to eruptions or groundquakes. As a result, the advozse people ended up having little attachment to material goods or long-term plans, and developed a pessimistic, selfish, and even paranoid outlook on life. This facet of their culture remained long after contact with the Galactic Republic gave them access to modern construction techniques allowing for more permanent buildings. Seeing financial stability as the only truly achievable stability one could find in life, the advozsec constantly strive to accumulate as much monetary wealth as they can in a lifetime in order to have the ability to rebuild when the worst happens.

### Names
Advozsec have simple names that do not distinguish between genders, using familiar surnames.

**First Names.** Dleck, Fjemm, Gorde, Rollar, Xon

**Surnames.** Ghantere, Leventraim, Timack, Vy, Zimda

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:415px'></div>

### Advozse Traits
As an advozse, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Advozsec reach adulthood in their late teens and typically live for over half a century.

***Alignment.*** Advozsec's paranoid and pessimistic nature causes them to tend towards balanced alignments, particularly lawful balanced, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Advozsec typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 130 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision*** Your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier.

***Horn.*** Your sharp horn is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage.

***Lava Dweller.*** Your body is well accustomed to extreme heat, giving you resistance to fire damage.

***Vigilant.*** When you would roll initiative, you can choose to have advantage on the roll. Once you've done so, you must complete a short or long rest before you can do so again.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Advb. Advb sounds quick and aggressive. It's incredibly rare to find a non-advozsec speaking Advb, some linguists even considering it all but a dead language.

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The aing-tii are a species of sentient, toothless mammals who stand on two clawed feet with two spindly arms, each with three large digits. Their bodies are covered in jointed white, bony plates covered in unique painted motifs. The aing-tii head is small and juts out perpendicularly from their chest, featuring two large eyes and six long, thin, green tongues extending from their mouths. They have a long, prehensile tail. The species is incapable of producing sound and conveys information via tasting, smelling and touching each other with their tongues.

### Society and Culture
The aing-tii are native to a planet whose location in the Kathol Rift is a closely guarded secret. Although in a dangerous area of space, the majority of Aing-Tii never leave their homeworld nor have any contact with the outside world. Those who do—commonly called aing-tii warrior monks—are often xenophobic and reclusive. The monks spend their entire lives performing errands for their gods, in the hope that they will receive "an answer" from them. The aing-tii hate slavery, and often attack slavers who roam the Kathol Outback.

While the aing-tii are Force-sensitive, they avoid wielding the Force, which they see as sacred. The aing-tii believe that everything is somehow guided by the Force. They do not believe in the light or dark sides of the Force. Instead, they hold that there are many different aspects to the Force.

### Names
Aing-tii names are, in reality, non-verbal and only truly understandable via taste, smell, and touch.  The few aing-tii who have been known to the outside world have used translators to convey an auditory identifier. 

**Male Names.** Ben'Sur, Looshen'Fel, Tadar'Ro

**Female Names.** Kulan'Pa, Laman'So, Te'Nuriel 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:460px'></div>

### Aing-Tii Traits
As an aing-tii, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Aing-tii reach adulthood in their late teens and live more than a century.

***Alignment.*** Aing-tii's foreign nature causes them to be hard to understand. Most aing-tii tend toward neutral light side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Aing-tii typically stand 6 to 7 feet tall and generally weigh about 200 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Armored Plates.*** You have thick armored plates. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

***Closed Mind.*** Aing-tii have a natural attunement for the Force, which makes them resistant to its powers. You have advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws against force powers.

***Force-Sensitive.*** You know the *force push/pull* at-will force power. Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your forcecasting ability for this power.

***Prehensile Tail.*** You have supreme control over your tail and can use it to manipulate objects as well as your hands.

***Wisdom of the Elders.*** You are proficient in the Lore skill.

***Languages.*** You can understand, read, and write Galactic Basic, and the non-verbal communication of the aing-tii. However, you cannot speak or make noise verbally.

<div style='margin-top:39px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Aleena are short, reptilian bipeds with large eyes and wide mouths full of small, sharp teeth. Aleena's bodies are long compared to their short arms and stubby legs. Warm-blooded reptiles, they possess exceptional reflexes as well as a fast metabolism which allow them to convert food into energy very rapidly in order to escape predators on their harsh home planet. 

### Society and Culture
Aleena are social and tend to thrive best in with close-knit teams if not with their own kind. They develop strong loyalties to friends and protect those they care about fiercely. Due to their inborn curiosity, the aleena are stereotypically galactic travelers, tourists in every sense. This, combined with their strong dedication to their relatives, results in aleena families traveling even to most unusual and dangerous locations just to see its sights. The appearance of aleena family walking through an intergalactic metropolis is a common sight on many planets. The aleena's love of sports and particularly, adventure and thrill sports, draw many into the galactic community. Most who enter professional classes are experts or diplomats. 

Aleena settlements were small, and most individuals were part of a single lineage, or tahiko. The leader of each tahiko led the community, and represented their wishes to the planetary advisory body. The advisory body elected a king to govern the planet, and was generally revered as a religious figure as they led religious ceremonies. 

### Names
Aleena names are generally short and guttural, with longer names being saved for royalty. Surnames are based on their tahiko, or tribal lineage.

**Male Names.** Batts, Gratz, Wakka, Zakan, Zetts

**Female Names.** Arkei, Harza, Sutci, Tsuon, Yenn, 

**Surnames.** Anares, Kylar, Ors, Practes, Targae

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:280px'></div>

### Aleena Traits
As an aleena, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Aleena reach adulthood in their late teens and live to be about 80.

***Alignment.*** Aleena's benevolent yet curious nature causes them to tend toward chaotic light side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Aleena typically stand 2 and a half to 3 feet tall and generally weigh about 35 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Bite.*** Your sharp teeth are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage. Lastly, as a bonus action, you can perform a special bite attack. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), and you can't use this trait again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Cosmopolitan.*** You have proficiency in Lore.

***Nimble Escape.*** You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.

***Nimbleness.*** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

***Racer's Reflexes.*** Whenever you make a Dexterity ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can choose to add 1d4 to the result. You can choose to do this after the check is rolled, but before the DM determines if you've passed or failed the check. You cannot do so again until you complete a short or long rest.

***Undersized.*** Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons. You can't use heavy shields. Additionally, you can't use martial weapons with the two-handed property unless it also has the light property, and if a martial weapon has the versatile property, you can only wield it in two hands.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Aleena. Aleena is characterized by its use of short syllables and energetic movements to convey urgency and emotion.

<div style='margin-top:39px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Anomid are a species of humanoids with translucent, purple-hued skin that is smooth but wrinkles with age. They have large, slender hands with six fingers on each: two end fingers, two center fingers and two thumbs, with a sharp claw on each. The fingers are paired in twos and slightly spaced apart from the others. The eyes of the anomids are solid, with no visible irises or pupils and have been seen in varying shades of yellow or blue. The anomids have pointed, fin-like ears that protrude from the sides of their heads. Anomid hair is often long and well kept, and is always found in shades of black, gray or white.

### Society and Culture
Anomids almost always wear elaborate masks which cover most of their faces. These are not breath masks, but vocalizer units. Since anomids have no vocal cords, they rely on these vocalizer masks to communicate with other species. These masks are often elaborately customized to reflect an anomid's social status, family origin, or profession. Among themselves, anomids communicate using an elaborate sign language. Anomid sign language requires six-fingered hands, which makes it difficult for humans or human-programmed protocol droids to use.

Anomid civilization has a long history of pacifism and technical achievement. In fact, most Anomids are pacifists—historians believed that no major wars have ever been fought in the Yablari system.

### Names
Anomid names are usually one or two syllables long, featuring hard consonants. Female names are often softer, with a greater flow to them. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Arkis, Jarak, Magris, Vell 

**Female Names.** Apharis, Eralie, Siphanie, Ulaniye 

**Surnames.** Dekan, Krest, Narroc, Quill, Wode

<div style='margin-top:62px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The anx are a bipedal, reptilian species discernible by their height, their tall crests, and their tails. Originating from a world with higher-than-average gravity, the anx possess a stooped stature. Their heads are tall and blade-shaped, with a soaring crest which acts as a sinus cavity. While their crests change color to reflect their moods, its primary function gives anx a low rumbling voice. An anx's large, muscular tail serves as a counterbalance for running.

Anx have long necks and limbs, and would appear taller if they didn't walk with their shoulders stooped and their crested heads held out in front of them.

### Society and Culture
The anx are serene giants who assume many roles in the Republic. Evolving from herd animals, the anx are a placid, sociable race known for developing a near fanatical interest in groups they related to. Living in complicated clan structures, anx enjoy the company of their large families and are more comfortable in groups. 

An innate trait among the anx is a formidable knowledge of anatomy, especially in regard to nerves, muscles and bone structures. Due to this extensive knowledge, even by species they have never encountered, the anx are considered dangerous unarmed combatants and skilled warriors, capable of incapacitating opponents with a single, well-placed strike.

### Names
Anx names are less harsh-sounding compared to those of other reptilian species. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Drexol, Graxol, Horox, Theen

**Female Names.** Kendiula, Madurrin, Pipalidi, Quiyya

**Surnames.** Fida, Jur, Kelvyyn, Ryyd

<div style='margin-top:296px'></div>

### Anx Traits
As an anx, you have the following special traits:

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Anx reach adulthood in their late teens and live up to 120 years.

***Alignment.*** The anx's social nature causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Anx stand at around 8 feet tall and weigh about 200 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Acute Smell.*** Whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check involving smell, you are considered to have expertise in the Perception skill.

***Anatomical Knowledge.*** You have proficiency in the Medicine skill.

***Subsonic Bellow.*** As an action, you can violently expel air in a 15-foot cone. When you do so, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). A creature takes 2d6 sonic damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 4d6 at 5th level, 6d6 at 11th level, and 8d6 at 17th level. This ability has no effect on constructs. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

***Surgical Strikes.*** Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage. Additionally, as a bonus action, you can perform a special pressure point attack. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, and it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the target is stunned until the end of its next turn, and you can’t use this feature again until you complete a short or long rest.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Anx. Anx is mostly characterized by low, rumbling noises made by the throat, amplified by an anx's crest. Anx are able to communicate over long distances with each other by using loud low-frequency sounds.

<div style='margin-top:113px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The anzellans are a diminutive species hailing from the secluded planet Anzella. Their eyes have floating corneal micro-lenses that allow them to see microscopic details. Anzellans are a bubbly and receptive people. They are a jovial and trusting people that tend to welcome strangers with open arms.

Due to their volcanic homeworld, anzellans are also adapted towards heat. This, coupled with their small size, make them well-suited to working in compact places.

### Society and Culture
Anzella is a tropical planet covered in thousands of small volcanic islands. Many of these islands are developed as small villages, with the largest islands designed to accommodate larger species. Anzellan culture is generally based around tourism and crafting; in fact, anzellans are renowned craftsmen due to their discerning eyesight and ability to fit into small spaces.

Anzellan government is generally casual. Each village has its own governing council of rotating members; these villages act independently from one another unless their decisions would affect more than a single island. In that case, all of the councils work together to come to a planet-wide decision. 

### Names
Anzellan names are rarely longer than two syllables, with a bouncy intonation to them. Their surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Babu, Gridel, Moru, Rano, Yodel

<div style='margin-top:35px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
An amphibious species native to the planet Ando, the Aqualish people have two facial tusks which curve down over their mouths; a trait which added to their appearance as arachnids. These facial tusks are highly sensitive to heat and cold and are used for cracking open the hard shells of shellfish or burrowing through the swampy loam of their homeworld. Having finned hands and two bulbous black eyes, Aqualish are unable to manipulate most machinery or equipment developed by the galaxy's many species which designed these tools for beings with digits. As a result, Aqualish tend to remain on their homeworld. Aqualish are well known for their hair-trigger tempers that flare without reason.

While Force-sensitive Aqualish are rare, members of the species have trained as both Sith and Jedi, though they typically gravitate toward the former.

### Society and Culture
The Aqualish hate the image they have in the galaxy as thugs, regardless of its veracity, and blame it on any- and everyone else. Because of this, the species are considered pariahs on Ando, which has a lower population of Aqualish than the galaxy itself. All Aqualish speak mutually intelligible dialects of the<br> same language. Quarrelsome and thug-like, the<br> Aqualish culture revolved around aggression and toughness, with diplomacy being one of their weakest<br> attributes.

### Names
Aqualish names are intended to sound strong. Surnames are not familial, but are chosen by each individual Aqualish.

**Male Names.** Bung, Gu, Opege, Soni, Tubop

**Female Names.** Cestirki, Duni, Iftu, Sifre, Umi

**Surnames.** Dogomurra, Julo, Kronem, Nidoal, Utix

<div style='margin-top:440px'></div>

### Aqualish Traits
As an Aqualish, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by<br> 1.

***Age.*** Aqualish reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Aqualish' aggressive personalities cause them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Aqualish stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh around 190 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Arms Dealers.*** Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check related to buying or selling weapons, you are considered to have expertise in the Persuasion skill.

***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.

***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Menacing.*** You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill.

***Swim.*** You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Aqualish. Aqualish is a harsh, guttural language. It's rare that other species bother to learn it unless they regularly interact with Aqualish.

<div style='margin-top:39px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Arcona have anvil-shaped heads, claws, marble-like eyes, and protective skin. Cona is always hot, and has very little water, but the atmosphere is filled with ammonia vapor. Arcona adapted to this environment by eating the ammonia-converting roots of flora as a source of water. Arcona depended on the ammonia to live and, as a result, arcona living offworld have to take ammonia supplements. Despite their large eyes, arcona have very poor eyesight. Their eyes, made up of thousands of photoreceptors, can not detect fine shapes, only seeing blurry objects. To aid this, they have a small sensory organ between their eyes. Often mistaken for their nose, this organ detects heat patterns from living beings. Thus, arcona can recognize things by its heat pattern.

Arcona are highly susceptible to addiction to spice and common salt, which serves as a hallucinogen with effects resembling that of intoxication. Their eyes shift to gold after prolonged addiction.

### Society and Culture
Arcona normally think of themselves not as individuals but as a collective whole. Largely forsaking individuality, they often refer to themselves as "we" even when alone. The arcona live in loose, family-based communities called nests, which are ruled by a Grand Nest. Because arcona are born in nests underground, they obtain a close sense of family living in close quarters with siblings. Males raise the young, since females are typically impulsive thrill-seekers. 

### Names
Arcona names are quite diverse, named by their fathers in the nest. Surnames are either familial or nest-based. 

**Male Names.** Bijrik, El, Jat, Kazat, Onalol, Shle

**Female Names.** Ak, Cimam, Cuten, He, Madan, Omik

**Surnames.** Cheen, -drell, -faxel, Shran, Takonak, -voll

<div style='margin-top:280px'></div>

### Arcona Traits
As an arcona, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Arcona reach adulthood in their late teens and live for more than a century.

***Alignment.*** Arcona tend toward no particular alignment. They can vary from the chaotic thrillseekers to the orderly lawkeepers. The best and worst are found among them.

***Size.*** Arcona typically stand 5 and a half to 6 and a half feet tall and generally weigh about 140 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Claws.*** Your sharp talons are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage.

***Clever.*** You have proficiency in one Intelligence skill of your choice. 

***Easily Addicted.*** Arcona are susceptible to spice addiction, and as a result you are taught to identify it from an early age. Additionally, consuming salt can cause them to hallucinate, potentially replicating the effects of spice. Whenever you make an ability check related to identifying salt or spice or seeing whether something contains salt or spice, you have advantage. 

***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, your thick hide is naturally adapted to hot climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

***Keen Smell.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve smell.

***Reptilian Senses.*** Whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check related to sensing heat, you are considered to have expertise in the Perception skill.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Arconese. Arconese is spoken through complex, guttural squeaks from the back of the throat. However, arcona born and raised in colonies outside of Cona often did not learn Arconese, but the local language instead.

### Biology and Appearance
Ardennians are sentient humanoid simians hailing from the tropical paradise of Ardennia. They are covered in fur from head to their wrists and ankles, with brown and grey being the most common fur colors. Ardennians sport four arms and prehensile feet. All six of their limbs are equally dexterous.

### Society and Culture
The Ardennian people themselves are a friendly communal species that are well known for welcoming visitors and inviting newcomers to traditional feasts and dances on the sandy beaches of Ardennia. Rural Ardiennan's live in modern tree-villages in the thick, dim jungle canopy on the majority of the islands. Ground level accommodations are available for off world visitors even in the smaller villages. Most off-worlders stay in the large modern resort complexes which boast having miles of private beaches or in the modern cities. Several large cities exist, scattered around the world, which typically encompass an entire island or a series of smaller islands joined together.

Ardennia's distance from the main hyperlanes makes it one of the lesser-known vacation destinations, but it's a popular one for those who don't mind the extra travel time. Some affluent visitors prefer the solitude that Ardennia offers, and occasionally end up purchasing one of the smaller islands to build their own home. Ardennia is notable for having the most beach per square meter in the galaxy. 

### Names
Ardennian's names are typically concise and rarely more than two syllables, with a familal surname.

**Male Names.** Rio, Jakar, Hul, Lup, Quil, Jerno

**Female Names.** Rac, Bras, Nuc, Kua, Karta, Sanya

**Surnames.** Betal, Durant, Jabut, Karon, Rambuan

<div style='margin-top:84px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Arkanians are a robust near-human species with solid white eyes and clawed, four-fingered hands.

Arkanians are capable of seeing into the infrared spectrum, and their eyes are sensitive to sources of extreme heat. This proved helpful on their dark and frigid homeworld, but when traveling offworld, many must wear blinders on planets with hotter, younger suns. It is not unheard of for arkanians to undergo genetic or cybernetic manipulation of their own bodies, enhancing themselves so as to be better than "lesser" species.

### Society and Culture
Arkanians are notoriously arrogant, a trait which came from generations of producing some of the galaxy's greatest advancements in genetics and technology. Their homeworld, Arkania, has vast quantities of precious gems; thus, the arkanians have never wanted for much in trade. This wealth went into funding their ambitious scientific projects, the most elaborate of which take generations to be completed. 

Many arkanians have come to see their species as the pinnacle of evolution, and amongst the most—if not *the* most—intelligent beings in the galaxy. Those species that are not already put off by their aloof nature often fear them, as tales of "mad scientists" and horrific experiments tend to surround them.

### Names
Arkanian names are simultaneously dignified and succinct. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Arkoh, Hyrim, Zeta, Suprin 

**Female Names.** Shenna, Elizie, Cratala, Hanna 

**Surnames.** Focela, Barzane, Nasdra, Athacorr

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:340px'></div>

### Arkanian Traits
As an arkanian, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Arkanians reach adulthood in their late teens and live about 100 years.

***Alignment.*** Due to their arrogance and unscrupulous experimentation, arkanians tend towards lawful dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Arkanians typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 140 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Arkanian Brilliance.*** Whenever you make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw using Intelligence, you can choose to add 1d4 to the result. You can choose to do this after the check is rolled, but before the DM determines if you've passed or failed the check. You cannot do so again until you complete a short or long rest.

***Crafters.*** You have proficiency in one tool of your choice.

***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Honed Mind.*** You have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against force and tech powers.

***Infrared Sight.*** Whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check related to sight, you are considered to have expertise in the Perception skill.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Arkanian. Arkanian, when spoken, has an airy tone, and is regarded as one of the most difficult written languages to learn.

<div style='margin-top:54px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Physically similar to humans, balosars appear to be sickly and gaunt when compared with the galaxy's most common species due to the heavy pollution of their homeworld. The most striking difference between balosars and humanity is a pair of antennapalps which sprouts from underneath the thick, coarse hair on their skulls. Retractable, these atennapalps allow them to listen into the subsonic range and give the species physical intuition and preternatural reflexes, which members of the Jedi Order sometimes mistook for Force-sensitivity. Balosars also possess an acute tolerance for poisonous substances, a byproduct of life on their toxic homeworld.

### Society and Culture
Early in its history, the balosar homeworld was overrun by galactic megacorporations eager to exploit the world's lax ecological protection laws. The planet was home to the balo mushroom, a key ingredient in death sticks, one of the galaxy's most infamous narcotics. After its discovery, Balosar was wrought with corruption, addiction, and pollution from the production and usage of death sticks.

Since there is little opportunity to flourish on their homeworld, balosars often leave in search of fortune elsewhere. Their natural resistance to the lethal—but not the addictive—effects of the drug encourages some to enter the death stick business.

### Names
Balosar names have a slight exotic tinge to them—often because Balosar parents name their children while on a death stick high. Their surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Barin, Elan, Fantes, Zerba 

**Female Names.** Delaana, Ferrika, Reki, Vetyl 

**Surnames.** Cher'dak, Mer'darro, Sel'Sabagno

\columnbreak

<br><div style='margin-top:435px'></div>

### Balosar Traits
As a balosar, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Balosars reach adulthood in their late teens and live about 70 years naturally, though death stick addiction has lead to a general decline in their lifespan.

***Alignment.*** Balosars are notoriously cynical, selfish, and pragmatic, causing most to be neutral dark side. However, there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Balosar stand at an average height of about 5 feet, and weigh about 115 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Keen Hearing.*** Your antennapalps give you advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks based on hearing.

***Snap Senses.*** Through your antennapalps, you can sense incoming danger and react accordingly. When you roll for initiative, you can choose to gain advantage on the roll. Alternatively, if you are surprised, you may act normally on your first turn. Once you've used this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

<div style='margin-top:54px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Barabel are a bipedal species of reptilians who are covered in very tough dark colored scales. Evolved from nocturnal lizards, the Barabel adapted a thick layer of fat which allowed them to remain active and not sluggish when temperatures dropped. A blaster set on stun would not damage them at all or slow them down, as it would merely bounce off their scales. Barabel are able to shed their tails if necessary, an ability that proved the undoing of many startled foes. They also possess heavy retractable claws along with needle sharp teeth which can grow to be 2 inches in length. A carnivorous species, Barabel possess two stomachs in order to process the massive amount of food they required to survive.

### Society and Culture
Living in low tech communities ranging from a few dozen individuals to no more than ten thousand, the Barabel community is built around a warren where the group thrives and hunted from. The Barabel species is noted for its hunting and tracking prowess; many of their actions are fueled by their hunting instincts, leading to the general feeling that Barabel are always angry. They are well known for their aggression but are also extremely loyal. They also have a great deal of respect for the Jedi because of their first experiences with a Jedi Master who settled a dangerous clan dispute. Apologies, whether for a misdeed or in sympathy, are an unknown concept to Barabel and are considered insulting.

### Names
Barabel names are harsh and gutteral. Female names are often softer. Surnames are warren-based.

**Male Names.** Anidroks, Bridiz, Trurzuk, Vilzinok

**Female Names.** Alge, Bulzo, Ekthamo, Inako, Nolku

**Surnames.** Akken, Dutarca, Khigta, Srabulgid, Zhomo

<div style='margin-top:25px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
A hunchbacked species of sentient reptilians, the bipedal baragwin are easily recognized across the galaxy. Noted for their thick, wrinkled skin which can resist most physical attacks and their shuffling gait, the large-headed race have no obvious differences between male and female baragwin. An acute sense of smell give the species enough sensitivity to detect another being's mood and feelings. This leads some of them into careers as big-game hunters, or even as bounty hunters. Due to their ponderous movement, many non-baragwin believe the race to be a dull-witted people while, in fact, they are quite intelligent. Despite this fact, the baragwin frequently keep this intelligence hidden, using the misconceptions of others to their own advantage.

### Society and Culture
Baragwin culture, since it does not derive from a single homeworld, is highly dependent on a baragwin's planet of origin, with Tatooinian baragwin behaving quite differently from those from Denuhi-Eight. Baragwin generally have little prejudice, treating all other beings equally regardless of species, culture, or planetary origins; though criminal baragwin will exploit all beings equally instead. Baragwin settlements are generally small and anarchic, with short-term leaders selected by informal democratic processes. Baragwin are famous as skilled weapon-smiths and introduced many different weapons to different worlds. Baragwin-made blasters and vibroblades are among the most powerful personal weapons in the galaxy. 

### Names
Baragwin have names with wide tones, spoken using the entire mouth, that don't differentiate by gender. Baragwin use familial surnames.

**First Names.** Dagel, Eskaul, Idalli, Migo

**Surnames.** Fadani, Igara, Kodrue, Wylbas

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:370px'></div>

### Baragwin Traits
As a baragwin, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Baragwin reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Baragwin tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them. 

***Size.*** Baragwin typically stand 5 to 7 feet tall and generally weigh about 200 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Arms Dealers.*** Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check related to buying or selling weapons, you are considered to have expertise in the Persuasion skill.

***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. 

***Keen Smell.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve smell.

***Natural Empathy.*** Baragwin's powerful sense of smell allows them to sense the emotions in those around them. You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine emotions against humanoids and beasts within 10 feet of you.

***Travelers.*** You have proficiency in the Survival skill.

***Weapon Developers.*** Baragwin are famous throughout the galaxy for their quality arms manufacturing. You have proficiency with armstech's implements, munitions kits, or two weapons of your choice.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Baragwinian. Baragwinian is a deep language with low rumbling vocalizations. The baragwin themselves, however, are not especially fond of this language. Most of them learn the languages used on whatever planet they were born, so Baragwinian is not very common. Baragwinian is still considered useful as a trade language, however.

<div style='margin-top:50px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Male Besalisks' heads sported prominent crests and four arms hung at their sides; females of the species could have as many as eight arms, but like Humans had a primary hand and a limited range of functionality with the others. The addition of the extra appendages required a hearty metabolism, and these bulky beings were able to store food and water for many days, and if the need arose, they could survive for long periods without either. Scruffy sensory whiskers lined the area below their noses, just above the robust wattle most adult Besalisks possessed.

### Society and Culture
Because of Ojom's harsh environment, large cities were never developed on the world; instead small communes of about a thousand families claim territories around the world and are each led by an elected leader. The communes have a strict policy of keeping the size of their groupings equal to avoid conflict. When too many families grow in one area, the leader would ask certain families to break away and start a new community on another glacier.

While not involved in galactic politics and because they do not produce any of their own technology, the Besalisks established large orbital space stations where offworlders could come to do business. Trading and making deals, any violence on these stations is committed by offworlders as Besalisks avoid confrontation.

### Names
Besalisk name's are generally words that embody them, with a surname attached to their commune.

**Male Names.** Darius, Dexter, Plun, Pong

**Female Names.** Delia, Mora, Ren, Teen

**Surnames.** Jettster, Kil, Krell, Ugg

### Besalisk Traits
As a Besalisk, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Besalisks reach adulthood in their early teens and generally live to be about 70.

***Alignment.*** Besalisks tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.

***Size.*** Besalisks tower over almost all other species, with the smallest standing at 6 feet tall and weighing 200 lbs., and the largest approaching 8 feet tall and 400 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Four-Armed.*** Besalisks have four arms which they can use independently of one another. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required).

***Long-Limbed.*** When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.

***Powerful Build.*** Your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Besalisk.

<div style='margin-top:39px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
A species of furry mammalians, the caamasi are covered in dense fur and have a spicy, woody body scent that is similar to that of Corellian whiskey. They have long arms with three-fingered hands, and pointed ears which stick out from the sides of their heads. They also have extremely acute senses of smell, with their nose positioned at the end of a tooth-filled snout. Caamasi have the interesting ability to share vivid memories called memnii with their near relatives and Force-sensitives. A memnis is as vivid to one who receives it as it was to the one who participated in the event remembered. Their peace-loving natures are in part due to memnii, as having a memory of killing or harming will be particularly strong, becoming unbearable in time, and something caamasi will seek to avoid except in defense of themselves or others, for which case they would accept their burden.

### Society and Culture
A pacifist race, culture on Caamas evolved around the basic tenets of peace and social justice; influencing the evolution of the Jedi Order. Working as explorers, diplomats, and artists, the caamasi are a monogamous people who value single partners while mating and starting a family. However following the devastation of their homeworld by the Empire, caamasi who were off-world at the time considered evolving to a position of polygamy so as to regrow the population. While the argument is one of survival, many sociologists familiar with the culture of the caamasi believe that they will not accept the idea.

### Names
Caamasi surnames are often composed of two parts, with the second part designating clan membership.

**Male Names.** Althanic, Gelerit, Ryg'gos, Shren

**Female Names.** Eeshraq, Heshrisa, Nulana, Yr'na

**Surnames.** A'kriy, I'tela, O'Tul, Sho'cyl

***Alignment.*** Caamasi's peaceful and just nature causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Caamasi typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 170 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Call for Peace.*** As an action on your turn, you can emphatically demand that your foes embrace peace, thereby distracting them. Until the end of your next turn, enemies within 10 feet of you that can see you gain disadvantage on attack rolls against your allies. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Diplomatic.*** You have proficiency in the Persuasion skill.

***Keen Smell.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Memnii Transfer.*** As an action, while touching a creature, you can initiate a memnii transfer. The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier), a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. On a failed save the target is stunned, and you can share vivid memories with the target as if they were their own for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a power). The transfer ends if you stop touching the target. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the saving throw to resist the transfer. On a success, the transfer ends. Otherwise, you may end the transfer on your turn (no action required). Once you've used this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. This feature has no effect on droids, constructs, or Force-Insensitive creatures.

***Scholarly.*** You have proficiency in the Insight skill.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Caamasi. Caamasi uses smooth tones and low volumes, making it soothing to listen to. Many popular nursery rhymes have been written in Caamasi to help children to sleep.

### Biology and Appearance
Chadra-Fan are covered from head to foot in fur. Their species evolved from small, arboreal rodents. The two different sexes of Chadra-Fan are indistinguishable to other species, though the Chadra-Fan could readily tell the difference using their powerful sense of smell. Chadra-Fan also have involuntary pheromones that conveyed information about their family line and created an aura of attractiveness. Other voluntary pheromones often conveyed a Chadra-Fan's state of emotion-anger, fear, or joy. Chadra-Fan even create more complex messages using their pheromones, though the pheromones when mixed sometimes caused confusion. They are unique in the fact that they had clear blood.

### Society and Culture
The society of Chadra-Fan is divided into a clan structure in which every member is responsible for parenting the clan's children; a fact of life is that every household is open at any time. Leadership within the clan is a temporary role that is passed from one individual to another as the situation calls for a particular expertise. Children are the centerpiece of a Chadra-Fan community, and only leave when wed. However the new Chadra-Fan couple remain with the smaller clan so it was possible that a Chadra-Fan never leaves his or her home.

Chadra-Fan left by themselves suffer depression, so they regularly seek the company of others; thus, Chadra-Fan are not very picky when it came to friends and prefer complete strangers to loneliness

You can dismantle the device to reclaim the materials used to create it.

<div style='margin-top:50px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Chagrians are born as tadpoles in clutches of three or more and raised in tubs of water in a family's private home. During this time, their arms, legs, and air-breathing lungs develop. Adult Chagrians are truly amphibious, retaining their ability to breathe underwater while also able to function without difficulty in air. They also possess acute low-light vision.

The average Chagrian stands taller than a Human. They are distinguished by two fleshy growths protruding from the sides of their heads, which they call lethorns. As they age, the lethorns thicken. Males also sport two horns growing from the top of their skulls. These were once used in underwater duels to attract a mate, and are seen as a sign of the males' strength and virility. Females lack the superior cranial horns, but had more pronounced and longer posterior head plates; these can reach halfway down their back. Chagrians also have very long black forked tongues.

### Society and Culture
As a species, Chagrians are generally peaceful and law-abiding to the point of becoming stoic and obstinate. Many Chagrians are motivated only by basic desires such as sustenance, shelter, and healthcare. Chagrian government ensures that every citizen is cared and provided for, so the standard of living for the poorest Chagrian is high compared to the members of other species. Chagrians who expect violence often wear red.

### Names
Chagrian names have a very melodic tone. Male names are typically shorter than female names. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Bom, Chen, Fiet, Nedd, Touk

**Female Names.**  Chavik, Dabai, Fisil, Oolya, Tinto

<div style='margin-top:67px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Chevin have long snouts which hang down nearly to their ankles. Combined with their intellect, this makes them skilled hunters of animals such as backshin, because they can smell out their prey or feed while keeping their eyes on the horizon. It is also their hunting prowess which allowed them to dominate their homeworld and conquer the Chevs. Chevin have thick legs, massive wide bodies, thin rope-like tails, and arms so long their three-fingered hands often brushed the ground.

### Society and Culture
Chevin live in small, mobile communities, with homes mounted on great wheeled carts. Even after they gained access to galactic technology, they continued to live as nomads (though more affluent Chevin mounted their lodges on large repulsorlift vehicles instead.) Their Chev slaves are usually forced to follow on foot. Nomadic groups of Chevin keep in touch via comlinks, and often converge on a single location to deal with danger.

The only Chevin settlements that stay in place for more than one standard month are the Government Villages, where Chevin dictators live with their hand-picked advisors. Even these settlements are movable when necessary. Each of the roughly two dozen Government Villages rules a Chevin nation.

### Names
Chevin names do not vary significantly based on gender. Surnames are based on community.

**First Names.** Buula, Ephant, Perre, Phylus, Reseros

**Surnames.** Meh, Mon, Nen, Needmo, Phrusaani

\columnbreak

### Chevin Traits
As a Chevin, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Chevin reach adulthood in their thirties and live up to 200 years.

***Alignment.*** Chevin warmongering and slavetrading cause them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Chevin stand between 6 and 8 feet tall and weigh up to 300 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

<div style='margin-top:69px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The chironian lower body has four legs, similar to that of a horse, and each ends in a dainty, cloven hoof. A chironian can sit down by folding his or her horse-like legs underneath the body. Chironians can also kick backward with both hind legs; this strong kick is sufficient to knock over other beings. A chironian's pace can vary between a walk, a canter, and a gallop.

Each year, chironian heads grows two horns above the temples. These horns start as small knobs covered by red-furred velvet: a vascular tissue. Once the knobs have grown sufficiently, they break through the velvet naturally, emerging as transparent horns, as bright as diamond, cool to the touch and with smooth ridges. However, if the velvet is cut artificially, chironians can die from the injury. Over time, the horns grow long and sharp enough that adolescent chironians can use them to gore opponents.

### Society and Culture
Chironians express emotions through the mannerisms of their hooves: when impatient, they stamp them; when excited, they tap them in a quick dance, or canter in a spot. The centauriforms frequently shake their heads and manes, and when angry, their faces flush a deeper shade. Young chironians, when frightened, are known to rub or press their velvet-covered horns against the foreheads of other beings to whom they are emotionally close.

### Names
Chironian names are soft and melodic, despite the thick nature of their native language. Important family names are passed down through generations. They don't use surnames. 

**Male Names.** Jefin, Slaturn, Cinall, Leathes

**Female Names.** Olachi, Luna, Sinall, Trespen

<div style='margin-top:416px'></div>

### Chironian Traits
As a chironian, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Chironians reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Chironians tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.

***Size.*** Chironians typically stand 6 to 8 feet tall and generally weigh about 600 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 40 feet.

***Cultured.*** You have proficiency in the Lore skill.

***Equine Build.*** Your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples. Additionally, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your hooves. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot. Finally, a Medium or smaller creature can ride on your equine back if you allow it. In such a situation, you continue to act independently, not as a controlled mount.

***Hooves and Horns.*** Your hooves (and depending on your age, horns) are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 kinetic damage.

***Powerful Charge.*** If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line before hitting with a melee weapon attack, you can attempt to trip the target prone as part of the same attack. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Chironan. Chironan is characterized by its soft, melodic sounds.

<div style='margin-top:38px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
In their natural form, clawdites resemble reptilian humanoids, having evolved from reptomammals. They have sunken cheeks with a narrow nose, a small mouth, large eyes with slit-like pupils, and a thin line that runs down their foreheads, creasing their nose. Clawdites possess an extremely rare ability to change their appearance. They can change the color and texture of their skin and eyes, and even grow hair, to mimic other species, though they cannot add significant physical mass to their bodies. 

### Society and Culture
By nature, clawdites are quiet and solitary beings, often shunning the company of others unless it benefits them. Due to their nature as shapeshifters, they are often mistrusted by strangers. Consequently, they view the galaxy pragmatically, and are often harsh realists.

Not all clawdites use their shapeshifting abilities due to the pain the transformation causes. These clawdites are often inclined to remain on their homeworld of Zolan, avoiding the company of other species.

On Zolan, clawdites are feared and shunned by the zolanders, who are a deeply religious people, believing that clawdites are impure and sinful. Zolanders force clawdites to live in slums scattered across the planet.

Those clawdites who leave their homeworld tend to gravitate toward professions that celebrate their shapeshifting, such as smuggling, bounty hunting, or espionage.

### Names
Clawdite names often have a rolling or hissing quality to them. Surnames are familial, though clawdites rarely use them.

**Male Names.** Nuri, Pol, Renneyn, Rosat, Turman

**Female Names.** Bargu, Cato, Murna, Sora, Zam

**Surnames.** Durra, Noviee, Parasitti, Virten, Wesell

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:326px'></div>

### Clawdite Traits
As a clawdite, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.

***Age.*** Clawdites reach adulthood in their early teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Clawdites' pragmatism cause them to tend towards neutral balanced, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Clawdites typically stand 5 to 7 feet tall and generally weigh about 140 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Changeling Instincts.*** You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Intimidation, Insight, and Persuasion

***Shapechanger.*** As an action, you can change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight, but not so much that your size changes. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species, though none of your game statistics change. You can't duplicate the appearance of a creature you've never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren't changed by this trait. You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.

***Unsettling Visage.*** When a creature you can see makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll. You must use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Using this trait reveals your shapeshifting nature to any creature within 30 feet that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic, Clawdite, and one more language of your choice. Clawdite is characterized by its rolling sounds paired with hissing sibilants.

<div style='margin-top:40px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Codru-Ji are humanoids generally near-human in their adult appearances, save for their four arms. While their hair, eye, and skin pigmentations tend towards earthen hues, brighter colorations such as blonde hair or blue eyes, though uncommon, also exist. Rarer still, some adults maintain a light coat of fur or elongated, pointed ears. These eccentric attributes result from their unusual childhood forms.

Codru-Ji children are actually sapient, six-legged canid creatures that cannot speak. Codru-Ji in this stage of their lives are called Wyrwulves: they mature to their more recognizable figures after reaching puberty. At that point, a blue, rubbery substance cocoons a Wyrwulf for several weeks before it emerges as a humanoid adolescent. They do, however, retain both the natural resilience and the enhanced hearing of their previous selves.

### Society and Culture
The Codru-Ji are proud and protective of their ancient customs, and they carefully manage their homeworld's economy to keep a degree of anonymity from the galaxy at large. They fear the tainting of their long-held practices by outside influence as well as prejudice against them for the almost barbaric level of callousness they will display towards one another in pursuit of personal gain. The kidnapping of a political rivals' children or the ransoming of off-worlders back to their people are both common practices. 

### Names
Codru-Ji names are often kept to two syllables. Clan names are appended to the given name as a hyphenated affix.

**Male Names.** Kossok, Tirrit, Uttar, Yunnan

**Female Names.** Davvi, Kella, Russa, Zollu 

**Clan Names.** -Fa, -Mu, Ro-, -Sy, Yi-

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Codru-Ji reach adulthood in their early teens and live less than a century.

***Size.*** Codru-Ji stand 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh around 160 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Keen Hearing.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.

***Natural Grappler.*** Whenever you make a Strength (Athletics) check to grapple you are considered to have expertise in the Athletics skill.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Codruese, which has a solemn and stately cadence to it.

<div style='margin-top:25px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Colicoids are tall insectoids that held multiple appendages. Their bodies are chitinous and include a powerful stinging tail. A colicoid's physiology allows them to curl up into a protective ball and unfurl suddenly which allow them to catch their prey unaware. This rolling method of locomotion is second nature to the colicoids. Their insectoid minds provide them a natural defense against mind tricks. 

Some members are colicoid queens that are different as they are more than twice the size of even the largest warrior breeds. This makes them extremely dangerous and are the only colicoids that possess a unique poisonous stinger. This combined with their strength and size makes them deadly combatants, especially when within their nests. However, a queen tends to only fight when her young are being threatened.

### Society and Culture
Though highly intelligent, colicoids are emotionless and cannibalistic in nature. Their ruthless cunning serves them well on the battlefield as it does on the negotiating table. It is known that long ago that they transferred these ruthless characteristics to their commerce activities. As a result, they are known to be brutally efficient in their business practices. They are noted for being vicious and calculating creatures that are driven by greed whilst showing little regard for others. The colicoids have numerous successful commercial ventures and hold strict business protocols. 

### Names
Colicoid names are typically very short and gender neutral, with surnames being based on the queen from which they spawned. 

**First Names.** Gal, Het, Kaf, Lyp, Nok, Yin

**Surnames.** Bek, Dor, Set, Tel, Wim, Zal

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:250px'></div>

### Coilicoid Traits
As a colicoid, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Strength or Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Colicoids reach adulthood by 8 and live to be about 65.

***Alignment.*** Colicoid's emotionless nature causes them to tend towards balanced alignments, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Colicoids typically stand 6 to 6 and a half feet tall and generally weigh about 170 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Acute Senses.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill. 

***Cannibalize.*** If you spend at least 1 minute devouring the corpse of a beast or humanoid, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one). Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

***Closed Mind.*** Colicoid brains have an unusual composition which gives them a natural defense against the Force. You have advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws against force powers.

***Defensive Ball.*** You are able to curl into a rolling ball for extra protection. When you take the Dash action while you aren't wielding a shield, you gain a bonus to AC equal to half your proficiency bonus until the start of your next turn. 

***Natural Armor.*** Due to your carapace and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your carapace provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.

***Stinger.*** Your stinger is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Colicoid. The Colicoid language uses sounds produced by the antennae and jointed legs of the colicoids, including humming sounds and clicks, which makes it difficult for other species to speak.

<div style='margin-top:149px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The culisetto are an insectoid species, with a close resemblance to the common fly. Their long snouts are not truly proboscises, but function much the same, allowing them to drain blood with the aid of two tendrils, one on either side of the snout. They move by crawling about on their hands and feet, and are adept at leaping and climbing.

Despite their appearance, culisetto are an exceptionally hygenic species, with an evolved habit of rubbing their hands and legs to rid them of germs from the ground.

### Society and Culture
Culisetto are often shunned by other species, if not for their grotesque appearance, then usually for their habit of drinking blood. They prefer to do so while their victims are alive, but tolerate it if they are recently dead. While they have evolved beyond needing to drink blood to survive, its taste remains quite enticing to many culisetto, who will indulge in it at their pleasure.

Culisetto tend to favor the company of their own kind, particularly their siblings. Broodlings frequently travel in groups of three or more, inseparable from birth.

### Names
Culisetto names are distinctively antiquated in their etymology. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Kreon, Sosilu, Ocyto, Phino

***Compound Eyes.*** Whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check related to sight, you are considered to have expertise in the Perception skill.

***Torpor.*** You only need 3 hours of sleep during a long rest to gain its benefits, instead of 6. Additionally, if your long rest would be interrupted, you only need to complete the long rest instead of restarting it to gain its benefits.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Culisetto. Culisetto is composed of high pitched whines made from the snout.

While defel appear to be visually similar to the shistavanen, they are very different on a biological level. Defel have the ability to bend waves of light in such a manner that it renders them practically invisible to the human eye. Despite this ability, they could be still be spotted by force-users and keen-eyed individuals.

Defel have extremely high perceptive ability because of their large ears, sensitive noses, and keen eyes. Because of the heightened levels of visual stimuli their eyes experience, defel are nearly blinded by sunlight but  can see rather well in the dark.

### Society and Culture
Defel live in tight-knit, interdependent communites underground. The harsh environment on Af'El turned the defel into rugged survivors, able to hold their own in the Galaxy. 

Defel have a strong sense of honor and will not associate with individuals that do not keep their word.

Because defel have yet to achieve interplanetary travel, they are a rare sight in the galaxy.

### Biology and Appearance
Diathim are a mysterious species of winged sentients famed for their radiance and beauty. They often make appearances as angelic figures in the folklore of numerous species. Their bodies naturally give off an intense light, obfuscating their physical forms to the naked eye. They have three pairs of thin, translucent wings that appear fragile, but are more than capable of flight. Diathim have been known to survive in the vacuum of space without the need for protective gear, and have a mild hypnotic effect on others in their presence, adding to the legends surrounding them.

### Society and Culture
The diathim give off an aura of kindness, and are consistently described as benevolent by spacers, causing tales of their rare appearances to morph over time into the grandiose mythology of the "Angels." The diathim are reputed for their beauty, and the way in which they appear varies depending on the beholder. Diathim are fascinated by spacecraft, which often prompted them to mob any ships that found themselves in the vicinity of their homeworld Iego and its largest moon Millius Prime.

Diathim have only commonly been seen gathering in flocks to welcome arriving ships, and knowledge of their habitat remains a mystery to outsiders. Although they have no apparent language of their own, they have readily adopted Galactic Basic, the common language of the galaxy.

### Names
Traditional diathim names are difficult to pronounce. When among other species, they tend to simply go by shortened nicknames for others to refer to them by.

**Birth Names.** Aiubhirr'merh, D'yz'xarh, Ihuithrhe, Vyxendel'ahitraxr

**Nicknames.** Mirra, Diz, Huu, Vix

***Age.*** Diathim reach adulthood in their late teens and live about 100 years.

***Alignment.*** Diathim are naturally empathetic, causing them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.

***Type.*** Your creature type is both aberration and humanoid.

***Celestial Physiology.*** You can survive for one day within the vacuum of space.

***Enthralling Hypnosis.*** You can use your psychic aura to influence individuals of both sexes.

Additionally, once per short or long rest, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower on a Charisma check as a 10. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.

***Flight.*** You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. While wearing medium or heavy armor, your flying speed is reduced by half.

***Fragile.*** Diathim are too weak to pack much of a punch. You have disadvantage on Strength saving throws, and when determining your bonus to attack and damage rolls for weapon attacks using Strength, you can’t add more than +3.

***Luminescent Aura.*** Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to amplify your radiant aura, causing a searing light to radiate from you. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and at the end of each of your turns, you and each creature within 10 feet of you take psychic damage equal to half your level (rounded up). In addition, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra psychic damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a power. The extra psychic damage equals your level.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and one extra language of your choice.

<div style='margin-top:33px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The Dowutin species evolved from a type of omnivorous herd animal on the planet Dowut. They were large, aggressive-looking humanoids with chin horns, sharp claws, thick skin, and had poor eyesight but superior senses of hearing and smell. Dowutin are massive humanoids who can live for centuries, and dying of old age is unheard of for them. While most other species become frail as they age, Dowutin never stop growing and getting stronger. As teenagers, Dowutin resemble Wookiees in size and strength, but by their fifth century, they are a mountain of muscle weighing a metric ton, with loud footsteps and voices warning other species away.

### Society and Culture
Dowutin are a very straightforward people, and their society is among the most simple in the galaxy. They have few cities, governments, or even organized social structures, as they often survive entirely on their own. Children are left behind by their families at a very young age and must learn to fend for themselves. Because of this, those who quickly learned hunting skills survived. Their size and strength made them prized as hired muscle, but most Dowutins' pride dissuaded them from such work, as they viewed other species as weak, absolutely refusing to take orders from anyone who is physically weaker than them. As such, those who employ Dowutin will command them in more subtle ways, typically phrasing their commands as suggestions or advice. Strength in the literal sense is very important to them; it is a measure of worth and earns them respect. 

### Names
Dowutin names are harsh and guttural, and roll off the tongue like a rock slide. Dowutin do not use surnames.

**First Names.** Dursuc, Grimgorl, Maucro, Tornak

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:381px'></div>

### Dowutin Traits
As a dowutin, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Dowutins are considered a child until around the age of 75 in which they are a full fledged adult. Dowutins can live upwards of 900 years with even more ancient ones exceeding that.

***Alignment.*** Dowutins are aggressive and brash, causing them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Dowutins have a unique special characteristic; from birth to death, they never stop growing. Even as an adolescent, dowutins tend to tower over other species, reaching heights over 8 feet and weighing 400 pounds. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Claws.*** Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage.

***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion due to extreme cold.

***Hunter.*** You have proficiency in the Survival skill.

***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve hearing or smell.

***Powerful Build.*** Your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Dowuta. Dowuta consists of deep, booming vocalizations and is considered difficult for members of other species to emulate.

<div style='margin-top:80px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Draethos possess large teeth, which grow outside of their mouths. Coupled with their lack of lips, this leads to the appearance of an overbite. Their scaly skin ranged in color from blue to purple to black. Their hands retain an interstitial web between the fingers. Their fingers end in narrow tips which resemble claws. They possess low-light vision, springing from their cave-dwelling ancestors.

Draethos possess a limited telepathy, granting the ability to communicate with any sentient being. The ability is limited to communication; a Draethos can not invade the thoughts of others.

### Society and Culture
Partly due to their long lives, Draethos society was slow to evolve and relies heavily on tradition. The Draethos' culture is warrior-based, and those living on the homeworld are expected to demonstrate their martial or hunting prowess. Life on Draethos is harsh, with arrogant aristocrats squabbling among one another for social standing and wealth. Warriors are perpetually in high demand as gladiators, mercenaries, hunters, and soldiers. Those who make a conscious decision to abandon the way of the warrior are exiled to seek a new life among aliens. Consequently, despite their reputation as fierce combatants, most Draethos encountered offworld are peaceful and intellectual.

### Names
Due to their lack of lips, Draethos names typically lack hard consonants. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Odan, Gyeto, Hurl, Jan, Talon

**Female Names.** Gillen, Teria, Kat'h, Yul, Aswe

**Surnames.** Urr, Slyter, Qelu'tlapa, Ayahu, Jek

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Telepathy.*** You can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet of you. You must share a language with the target in order to communicate in this way.

***Way of the Warrior.*** You have proficiency with light and medium armor as well as vibroblades and vibroswords.

<div style='margin-top:84px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Dugs are slender, powerfully built beings with a somewhat humanoid build and a unique method of walking that hailed from the high gravity world Malastare. Their primary means of locomotion is their strong arms, and their lower limbs and feet were used for grappling and other fine motor manipulation. They hardly ever walk on their lower limbs. Although most Dugs may walk on all four limbs, others like to use their strong arms as legs and their feet as hands like they would normally do.

### Society and Culture
Due to their oppression under their Gran rulers who colonized Malastare, many Dugs often feel the need to throw around their strength in bids to establish dominance. As a result, they are known for their ill-tempered demeanor, and many are bullying thugs.

On their homeworld of Malastare, the vast majority of Dugs are little more than laborers toiling for the enrichment of the Gran. With the species excluded from much of the power and money on Malastare, many Dugs turn to swoop racing or bounty hunting as their only means to achieve fame and fortune. In all other areas, the Dugs are exploited.

### Names
Dug names are often 3 syllables long, mostly through big sounds rather than harsh tones. There are harsher tones in their names as well though, often in the forms of x's and k's. Female Dugs have softer names, but no one would call them beautiful. Surnames are usually passed down through family or clan.

**Male Names.** Bawugri, Gadwouhx, Rorgukwa, 

**Female Names.** Bosix, Grugne, Jiwous, Pragiba,

The extra damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

<div style='margin-top:85px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Echani are characterized by their white skin, hair, and eyes, and their remarkable tendency to look very much alike one another to outside observers, particularly amongst family members. It is thought that their origins stem from Arkanian experimentation on the human genome, a hypothesis that could explain their physical conformity.

### Society and Culture
A matriarchal, caste-based society originating from the Inner Rim world of Eshan, the echani spread to encompass a confederacy of six worlds including Bengali and Thyrsus, known as the Six Sisters, governed by the all-female Echani Command. 
	
Echani generals are sometimes seen by others as having the ability to predict their opponent's next move. This is no biologicial trait inherent to the species, but rather stems from the fact that combat is so ingrained into every level of echani culture; the echani hold to the idea that combat is the truest form of communication, and to know someone fully, you must fight them. While their combat rituals require complete freedom of movement and unarmed martial arts, in warfare, they tend towards light armor and melee weapons, and are considered excellent craftsmen of such.

### Names
Echani names tend to lack hard consonants, but are otherwise as variable as human ones. Echani surnames are tied directly to their place in the caste system.

**Male Names.** Caelian, Inarin, Losor, Uelis, Yusanis 

**Female Names.** Astri, Brianna, Isena, Raskta, Senriel

**Surnames.** Authal, Elysi, Fenni, Kinro, Lsu

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Echani reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Echani culture's emphasis on honor and combat cause them to tend towards lawful alignments, though there are exceptions.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Unarmed Combatant.*** Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 kinetic damage and have the finesse property.

***Echani Art.*** If a humanoid you can see makes a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to make a Wisdom (Insight) check against the target's Charisma (Deception). On a success you learn one of the following traits about that creature: it's Strength, Dexterity or Constitution score; bonus to Strength, Dexterity or Constitution saving throws; armor class; or current hit points. On a failure, the target becomes immune to this feature for one day. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses on a long rest.

***Combative Culture.*** You have proficiency in Lore and Acrobatics.

***Martial Upbringing.*** You have proficiency in light armor, and gain proficiency with two martial vibroweapons of your choice.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and one extra language of your choice.

### Biology and Appearance
Esh-kha are a gray-skinned humanoid species with equine features, including muzzles and digitigrade legs. They also have small black eyes. 

### Society and Culture
In terms of society, their race's culture resembles that of a hive society though each individual retain their own thoughts and aspirations yet all being bred for a specific role that they were eager to fulfill. A caste system is present amongst the esh-kha which included Force-sensitive simple minded savants, more numerous skilled determined warriors that watched over them and finally the patriarchs that acted as leaders who provided their wisdom as well as decisions to their entire people. Esh-kha appear to outsiders as a savage violent species that care only for the destruction of all other races. This hatred for other sentient species is believed to had stemmed from their tightly-knit hive-like society. It is suspected that the esh-kha are simply unable to tolerate or even adapt to the existence of thinking of outsiders who only suffered their wrath. Their race only turns violent against one another in the most extreme of circumstances.

### Names
Whilst their kind are individuals, esh-kha are not named at birth but instead earn their names through their actions. An esh-kha that displayed great skill in battle could be called "Swift Blade", or maybe "Deadly Cutter" or some other such name. It is believed that this partly explained an esh-kha's zeal in battle with young warriors seeking not only victory but an opportunity to lay claim to a name and forge their own identity. Esh-kha do not use surnames, as they believe they are one family.

<div style='margin-top:48px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The Falleen are distinguished by their mottled green or red skin, ridged skulls, and their long, black hair which they typically wear in ponytails. The sleek symmetry of their features, calculating and cold demeanors, their exotic looks, and their ability to alter their skin pigmentation make the Falleen often considered to be among the most aesthetically pleasing beings in the galaxy. In addition to their strikingly beautiful appearance, the Falleen exude pheromones which makes them all but irresistible to both sexes.

The Falleen are semi-aquatic, being able to hold their breath underwater for an extended period of time. Fallen are one of few species that are resistant to manipulation by the Force.

### Society and Culture
Falleen society is of a feudal nature, with noble houses ruling over the lower classes. The upper echelons of Falleen aristocracy are rife with politics and intrigue, though they rarely spill blood over disputes or reduce themselves to open warfare.

As a cold-blooded species, the Falleen respect discipline and control, particularly self-control. They tend to shun public displays of emotion, and are very patient. As a result of this attitude, they tend to look down on the more openly passionate, whom they see as lacking self-control. Indeed, the Falleen as a species have a towering sense of superiority, reflecting on their view of Falleen as the civilized and cultural center of the galaxy, rather than Coruscant.

### Names
Falleen favor names with Z and X sounds. They are usually accompanied by a surname, which is familial.

**Male Names.** Xomit, Xizor, Xist, Zenex, Zurros

**Female Names.** Xora, Trezza, Mylla, Zule, Annaz

### Biology and Appearance
Felucians are a tall, bipedal species. Both their arms and legs end in four, large webbed digits with suction-cup fingertips. Springing from the underside of each forearm is a second short arm, ending in three large and agile fingers. A Felucian's head is a thick mass of long flexible tendrils featuring illuminated tips. The eyes and mouth appear as black holes or openings within this mass.

### Society and Culture
Felucians are mysterious sentient beings native to the vast fungal swamps and jungles of Felucia. Though Felucia has long been colonized, the native Felucians avoided notice by living deep in the jungle. Such seclusion was easily maintained. Even the hardiest of colonists were loath to brave the perils of the dangerous wilderness without cause.

The Felucians are an unusual, amphibious species. They are highly adapted to surviving the wilds of their home planet, and fade easily into its confusing mass of plant life. They are equally at home on land or in the water, and they traverse the swamps with ease.

All Felucians are part of a single, planetwide tribe that is broken down into smaller villages and communities, each one led by shamans and chieftains. These shamans are very strong in the Force, using it to their own ends with incredible skill.

### Names
Felucian names are usually two syllables and full of hard consonants. Surnames are a combination of tribe lineage.

**Male Names.** Gokkuul, Kargrek, Hagark, Ruggorn

**Female Names.** Lakko, Taarell, Duuna, Frula 

**Surnames.** s'Gokuul, d'Lakko, s'Kargrek, d'Frula

<div style='margin-top:69px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Flesh raiders are a more primitive, and more physically imposing subspecies of rakata that mutated prior to the end of the Infinite Empire. A life above ground and in caves has led the flesh raiders to lose their more amphibian traits, and are now more humanoid in their biological needs, though they seem to only be able to digest meats and flesh.

Flesh raiders keep many of their ancestral rakatan features, though they have experienced a form of gigantism that has lead to their interesting appearance, that of a flat topped, spade shaped head, with blade-like eye stalks coming off the side ends of the spade. Their body structure also more closely matches that of a trandoshan or dashade, being bulky and imposing in stature, towering over most other sentient creatures.

Unlike contemporary rakata, flesh raiders did not lose their ability to tap into the Force.

### Society and Culture
Flesh raiders are known to form small clan structures, with a war boss in charge of the clan. Those flesh raiders who are born Force-sensitive can be found imitating a temple structure, with a powerful Force-sensitive, usually from another species, leading them. 

Flesh raiders still speak the rakatan language, though it has developed into a cruder variant.

### Names
Flesh  raider names tend to be short and concise, embodying strength and virility. Flesh raider names make no distinction between male and female names. Surnames are clan-based, though they are rarely used.

**First Names.** Cha'nagh, Fashk, Gorshh, Keshk, Mar'govrok

**Surnames.** Ban, Fel, Kuir, Penk, Teeshk

<div style='margin-top:310px' ></div>

### Flesh Raider Traits
As a flesh raider, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom or Charisma score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Flesh raiders reach adulthoood by 20 and rarely live longer than 90 years.

***Alignment.*** Flesh raiders' propensity towards war and aggression cause them to tend toward chaotic dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Flesh raiders typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh around 200 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.

***Cannibalize.*** If you spend at least 1 minute devouring the corpse of a beast or humanoid, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one). Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Force Contention.*** Due to their unique physiology, flesh raider hardiness allows them to overcome use of the Force. You have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws against force powers.

***Menacing.*** You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.

***Hunters.*** Whenever you make a Wisdom (Survival) check to hunt for food, you are considered to have expertise in the Survival skill.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Rakata. Rakata is characterized by its deep tones and simplistic nature, using mainly consonants and long vowels. It's script seems to be a very ancient form of Galactic Basic.

<div style='margin-top:36px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Gand are sentient, stocky humanoids whose insectoid bodies are covered in a chitinous exoskeleton. The natural armor allow the Gand to shrug off injuries that would cripple most other species. The exoskeleton provides extra protection in the clavicle region, which prevented most nerve or pressure-point strikes to the neck and shoulders. In addition, Gands have the remarkable ability to regrow lost limbs. If a Gand is dismembered, it can regrow a lost limb in a few days. 

### Society and Culture
Gand society places heavy importance on the achievements of an individual and holds that an individual has no name, and thus no worth, until he or she proves otherwise. The speech patterns of Gands utilize third-person self-reference within each level of identity earned. Young or unproven Gands are all<br> called "Gand," as they are considered merely aspects<br> of the same whole. Major accomplishments earn the<br> use of a family surname. Mastering a skill, such as<br> becoming a findsman, allows for the use of the given<br> name, all with third-person self-reference. This manner<br> of speaking is common within the spoken and written<br> Gand language but is more predominant when a Gand<br> speaks Basic; it is often a source of amusement to<br> outsiders.

### Names
Until a Gand has earned the use of a name, they go simply by the term "Gand." Gand speak in the third person and refer to themselves by name. Often, when a Gand feels shamed, they will stop referring to themselves by their name and revert to calling themselves "Gand" until they prove themselves again. Male and female names are not distinct.

**First Names.** C'nyir, Dash, Iglid, Kyuffax, T'rix

**Surname.** Diqlu, Krakee, Praafri, Quudya, Zooq

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:486px'></div>

### Gand Traits
As a Gand, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Gand reach adulthood when they earn their name, which is usually in their teens, and live to be about 70 on average.

***Alignment.*** Gand tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.

***Size.*** Gand stand 4 to 6 feet tall and weigh around 100 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Exoskeleton.*** You have a thick exoskeleton. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier.

***Gand Resilience.*** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage (explained in chapter 9).

***Lungless.*** Gand do not have lungs, and therefore do not need to breathe.

***Regenerative.*** When you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend a Hit Die to regain hit points as long as the damage would not reduce your hit points to 0.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Gand. The Gand language does not use pronouns as Gand refer to themselves in the third person, so often Gand who speak Galactic Basic are difficult to understand.

<div style='margin-top:48px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The ganks are a species of fur-covered carnivores. The typical member of the species has a face that is squared-off and yellow in color, the expression trapped in a perpetual snarl that non-ganks find unattractive. Small, mean-looking eyes peer from above the maw, their head sitting atop a thick neck between broad, strong shoulders. These cap two thickset, powerful arms, which terminate in hands with five fingers each. Their heavy build affords ganks great strength, yet they are also spry runners. They augment their bodies with cybernetics, making them a species of cyborgs.

### Society and Culture
Precious little is known about gank culture. The exception is that the ganks are fabled for their violent and ruthless nature; even the slightest perceived insult is enough to throw a gank into a violent rage of retaliation. Outsiders similarly know little of the organization of gank society, or whether they have any central rulers at all. What is well known was that the ganks are a war-loving and regimented species, whose members enjoy occupations that allow them to fight and shed blood, such as that of assassin, bodyguard, bounty hunter, and mercenary. They are in particular demand by the hutts, who have enough ganks on retainer to constitute a small army. Their warlike ways and physical strength ranks the ganks among the galaxy's most redoubtable fighters. The species have no compunctions about premeditated murder, which lends them the nickname "Gank Killers."

### Names
Gank names do not differentiate between genders, and instead of surnames, they give themselves epithets. 

**First Names.** Darakk, Frent, Shett, Yorrath

**Epithets.** the Feared, the Keen, the Slayer, the Tough

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Geonosians have a hard chitin exoskeleton that provided protection from physical impacts and bouts of radiation that occasionally shower their world. Geonosians are strong despite their thin builds, and are capable of constructing massive hives and factories in concert. The head of a Geonosian is elongated and large with their skulls ridged on the top and by the side where they have bulbous, thick-lidded eyes. Both are physically strong and covered with bony ridges which protected their arms, legs, and vital organs. 

### Society and Culture
Geonosian society is caste-based with little upward mobility, though some of the lower caste do develop ambition. Workers are conditioned to loathe even the concept of separation from their hive and the system<br> of control. A low-ranking worker's normal life is one of<br> endless toil and labor to satisfy the aristocracy, who<br> are known to make spectacular demands. The warrior<br> caste tend to be highly competitive and are eager to<br> prove themselves. They are born with an abnormal<br> level of intelligence, and one of their only hopes of<br> escape from their rigid duty is entering voluntarily into<br> gladiatorial combat. Should they survive, they are<br> granted freedom. Ultimately, their society exist to<br> benefit those few members that reside in the upper<br> caste. Members of the aristocratic classes are known to<br> be ambitious, domineering, and manipulative. They<br> constantly move towards improving their standing and<br> holdings while sumultaneously working to ruin their<br> rivals.

### Names
Geonosian names are usually harsh sounding. Lower castes don't get surnames. Upper caste surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Buck, Goshey, Nik, Sozz, Techtu

**Female Names.** Datte, Kida, Miri, Nare, Tenessi

**Surnames.** Chak, Hor, Lur, Marpes, Zol

<div style='margin-top:65px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The Givin are a species of white-skinned, hairless humanoids who are quite frequently likened to animated skeletons. Their facial features include many sharp downward angles, large triangular eye sockets, and sloped-up brows that meet together in the middle, lending them an appearance of permanent anguish. Because of the harsh environment of their homeworld, the Givins' organs are sealed against atmospheric exposure; thanks to this complex system, they can survive for about a day in a vacuum.

### Society and Culture
In order to survive their homeworld's lunar tides, the Givin became extremely adept at calculating the trajectory of their celestial bodies. Over the ages, Givin have become so skilled at celestial navigation that they are able to calculate hyperspace jumps in their heads. As such, mathematics have become a cornerstone of Givin society. Two Givin will often greet each other by exchanging complex equations for the other to solve.

Due to their profound mathematical ability, Givin are skilled starship builders and astrogators. They create some of the most impressive, complex, and sleek ships in the galaxy. However, they frequently build their ships without the presence of a navcomputer or pressurization system, and so their buyers have to add these system in the starship aftermarket.

### Names
Givin names are often derived by parents from favored mathematical equations. Male and female names do not significantly differ. Surnames are familial.

**First Names.** Daggibus, Lersia, Na-Soth, Nisil, Sladru

**Surnames.** Alarin, Nalas, Narth, Larr, Scoritoles

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:486px'></div>

### Givin Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score<br> increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases<br> by 1.

***Age.*** Givin reach adulthood in their early teens and live about 80 years.

***Alignment.*** Givins believe power and respect are<br> earned rather than expected, causing them to tend<br> towards balanced alignments, though there are<br> exceptions.

***Size.*** Givin typically stand around 6 feet tall and weigh 150 lb. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Hardened Exterior.*** You have a tough, bony exterior. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

***Mathematical Savants.*** Whenever you make an<br> Intelligence (Technology) check involving mathematics,<br> you are considered to have expertise in the Technology<br> skill.

***Stargazer.*** You have proficiency in Piloting and<br> Technology.

***Vacuum Sealed.*** You can survive for one day within<br> the vacuum of space. You still require oxygen to<br> breathe. You have resistance to cold damage.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Givin. Givin is characterized by its use of mathematical jargon and symbols, making it nigh incomprehensible to the less mathematically inclined.

<div style='margin-top:31px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The gormak are green humanoids with flat, noseless faces adorned with frills, collecting in whorls on the sides of their heads. They have clawed, three-fingered, frilled hands, and tend to possess a muscular build. Females are slightly shorter than males and lacked a whorl located above their nose. 

### Society and Culture
An aggressive species, the gormak hold an innate love of warfare and competition, and are extremely hostile towards the other natives of their planet, the voss. The gormak hold a belief that in order for them to prosper, the voss, whom they view as a plague on the planet, must be destroyed. To achieve that goal, warriors have repeatedly assaulted the voss capital city over the course of centuries; however, despite their far greater numbers, their nature has kept them from uniting against their enemy. While their society and speech are considered primitive by galactic standards, their innate talent with technology rivals the top minds of the galaxy. From bits of scavenged electronics and equipment, the gormak construct advanced tools, heavy machinery, specialized weapons and even cybernetic implants. However, despite their incredible affinity for technology, the gormak remain a pre-spaceflight culture confined to their homeworld, which causes them to be viewed as a backward species despite being perfectly capable of repairing, modifying and improving tech created by more advanced cultures. 

### Names
Gormak are commonly named after heroes of their history by local shamans. Surnames are tribe-based, but optional. 

**Male Names.** Damal, Henet, Wockuss, Yryu, Zenit

**Female Names.** Finay, Heidith, Jhekon, Rakva, Sanas

**Surnames.** -Du, -Fo, -Qa, -Ry, -Ve

<div style='margin-top:35px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Gotals possess cranial horns as receptors to sense electromagnetism and other energy emissions. These nerve-ending filled cones can sense the natural electromagnetic fields produced by Antar 4's<br> magnetite-rich crust, allowing the species to operate<br> even in total darkness. Their senses also pick up the<br> electromagnetic auras from other life forms. When<br> close to their hunting targets, they can ascertain<br> information on its mood, awareness, and state of<br> mind. Electronic devices can also be sensed by Gotals;<br> in fact, most droids give off enough electromagnetic<br> emissions to at least annoy a Gotal, and at worst to<br> seriously disorient the horned beings, making them<br> notoriously distrustful of droids. Gotals rely heavily on<br> their cones, with their eyesight and hearing being<br> quite weak, and their sense of smell almost completely<br> absent. 

### Society and Culture
Since their natural empathy makes them instantly sensitive to the feelings of others, Gotals have little use for government or laws on their homeworld, resulting in problems when dealing with other societies. No central authority figure can speak for Antar 4 as a<br> whole in a crisis, and no organized Gotal military or<br> police force can act on their behalf. Other species<br> respect the Gotals for their discretion and restraint, but<br> some individuals fear interacting with the horned<br> beings for fear of having their emotional state revealed<br> to others.

### Names
Gotal names are quite guttural, though there are also many harsher tones within their names. Gotal names do not vary significantly based on gender, and surnames are familial. 

**First Names.** Thon, Fern, Fuu'rash, Jir, Vluphol

**Surnames.** Gratlul, Klux, Vathon, Zilat, Krigh, Rahxem

<div style='margin-top:34px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Gran can easily be identified by their three eyes and their goat-like snout. Female Gran also have three breasts. They have excellent vision, able to resolve more colors than most species, and even able to see into the infrared, thus they are able to sense one another's emotions and disposition by noting subtle changes in body heat and skin color. Gran have two stomachs, having evolved from herbivorous grazing animals who lived in herds on the mountains and highlands of Kinyen. A single meal can take almost an entire day to finish, after that a Gran does not often need to eat for several days.

### Society and Culture
The peaceful nature of Gran society is a reflection of their homeworld, Kinyen. Kinyen boasted large and rolling grasslands and highlands, a dense and beautiful forest, and one of the longest and clearest rivers in the Bes Ber Bikade sector. The beauty of this planet, and the need for primitive Gran to band together for defense against predatory animals, helped the Gran develop strong bonds of home and family in their society. 

The Grans are also very protective of their families, and were some of the most devoted parents in the galaxy. This is because of their very powerful and sensitive sight, which can sense the emotions of their mates and their children. Gran society maintains its balance by setting up strict career quotas, and making sure young Gran are educated for a specific job that best served his or her talents.

### Names
Gran names typically are monosyllabic and accompanied by a surname, which is familial.

**Male Names.** Ask, Dree, Ree, Pax, Nic

**Female Names.** Yan, Alijia, Meeb, Sir, Zeek

**Surnames.** Moe, Leem, Yees, Wix, Naaq

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:531px'></div>

### Gran Traits
As a Gran, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Gran reach adulthood around their late teens and live up to 80 years. 

***Alignment.*** Gran highly organized society cause them to tend toward lawful alignments, though there are exceptions..

***Size.*** Gran typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh around 170 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Slow Metabolism.*** You are able to go a number of days without food equal to 3 + twice your Constitution modifier before suffering exhaustion.

***Keen Sight.*** Through use of infrared vision, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. 

***Reader of Hearts.*** Through identifying subtle variations in a target's body heat, the Gran are able to better understand their emotions and intentions. You are proficient in the Insight skill. 

***Toughness.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Gran. It is rare to hear Gran spoken on any world other than Kinyen.

### Biology and Appearance
The appearance and biological features of half-humans vary drastically by each species, but tend to fall somewhere in the middle. A common side-effect of a species interbreeding with humans is the loss of darkvision and tails.

### Society and Culture
Half-humans are subjects of two separate cultures, but belong in neither. A half-human might be raised amongst humans or their other half, or might be fully ostracized, instead growing up in a remote, isolated place, removed from both species.

> #### Traits
> Half-humans gain the ***Defiant*** special trait from their human half. They also gain the special traits from their non-human half, except for those trait(s) mentioned in the Half-Human table above.

### Names
Half-human names might follow human conventions, or that of the other half. Often, they blend the two in some fashion, perhaps taking a human surname, with a special name.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:445px'></div>

### Half-human Traits
As a half-human, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Half-humans gain the ability score increases of their non-human half, but they can choose any ability score for one of the options, instead of the given option. Half-humans can not increase the same ability score twice during character creation using this feature.

***Age.*** Half-humans live around the average of the two species' lifespans.

***Alignment.*** Half-humans tend towards their non-human half's alignment.

***Size.*** Half-humans stand and weigh around the average of the two species' height and weight. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is the size of your non-human half.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is that of your non-human half.

***Defiant.*** Half-humans are known to be stubborn and often refuse to give up, even against the worst odds. When you or a creature you can see that can see and understand you makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can roll a d4 and add it to their roll (no action required). You can use this before or after the roll, but before the GM determines the roll's outcome. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic, regardless of whether or not the non-human half can speak it, and the language(s) associated with your non-human half.

<div style='margin-top:95px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The Harch possess a large-fanged mouth between two prominent chelicerae, above which they have six red eyes arranged in a semicircle. The two lowest eyes are larger and roughly twice the size of the four smaller eyes. Harch walk on two legs and have six arms, with the second and third set of arm protruding from behind the first pair rather than directly above or below them. These arms are covered in thick hair and end in three-fingered hands.

The Harch are distantly related to the Aqualish<br> species and there is much debate among geneticists<br> regarding the relationship between the Harch and the<br> Aqualish Ualaq subspecies. However, the Harch<br> themselves considered such discussions to be<br> obscene.

### Society and Culture
Not much is known about the Harch, as few of them have mingled with the galactic community, preferring to stay on Secundus Ando. Harch that leave the planet tend to have a more aspirant nature than their fellows, and often reach great heights in their chosen professions in the galaxy. Such Harch are considered outliers—most apparently care little for titles.

Like the Arcona species, female Harch are seen as more domineering and aggressive than their male counterparts. It is not unheard of for a male Harch to raise entire broods of hatchlings alone.

### Names
Harch names are not gender-specific. Harch do not use surnames.

**Names.** Cubach, Quixoch, Trench, Turch

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:320px'></div>

### Harch Traits
As a Harch, you have the following special traits:

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength, Constitution, and Intelligence scores increase by 1.

***Age.*** Harch reach adulthood at age 10 and can live up to 200 years.

***Alignment.*** Harch are cold, calculating beings, causing them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Harch stand around 6 feet tall and weigh between 200 and 300 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Bite.*** Your fangs are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage. Lastly, as a bonus action, you can perform a special bite attack. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the target is poisoned until the end of its next turn, and you can't use this feature again until you complete a short or long rest.

***Six-Armed.*** Harch have six arms which they can use independently of one another. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required).

***Spider Climb.*** You have a climbing speed of 30 feet. You have advantage on Strength saving throws and Strength (Athletics) checks that involve climbing, and while climbing you always have two hands free.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Harchese. Harchese is discernible from other insectoid languages by a noticeable emphasis on consonants, especially the "ch" sound.

<div style='margin-top:64px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The herglic are a massive race of creatures descended<br> from aquatic mammals, breathing though a blowhole<br> on top of their heads. They are tall and wide, and have<br> smooth, hairless skin that ranged in color from pale<br> blue to black, though some rare individuals may<br> appear pink or have white markings on their sides.<br> Their girth tends to leave them feeling out of place among smaller species; herglic tend to take up two chairs or fill the entire doorway of any establishment they enter that does not cater to beings their size.

### Society and Culture
The herglics are very technologically advanced, developing space flight and hyperdrives and colonizing their sector of the galaxy prior to the formation of the Galactic Republic. Natural explorers and traders, they sailed the cosmos establishing crucial trade routes and gaining prestige. Despite their size, herglic are surprisingly dexterous while working with tools, and are some of the finest engineers in the galaxy. 

Herglics have an inquisitive but practical nature, enjoying travel and having exotic experiences. Their perpetually calm demeanor  helps them interact with most other species peacefully, though when dealing with smaller species, herglics tend to become nervous and self-conscious about their proportions. They also seem to have an innate predilection for gambling and games of chance, which have gotten more than one herglic into trouble on several occasions.

### Names
Male names are typically harsher sounding than female names. Herglics rarely use surnames.

**Male Names.** Biglu, Melchi, Sehvorah

**Female Names.** Mahg-Raet, Seese, Uddn

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:530px'></div>

### Herglic Traits
As a herglic, you have the following special traits:

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score<br> increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by<br> 1.

***Age.*** Herglic reach adulthood in their late teens and live up to 120 years.

***Alignment.*** Herglics' gentle nature causes them to<br> tend toward the light side, though there are<br> exceptions.

***Size.*** Herglic stand between 6 and 8 feet tall and weigh up to 600 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Hold Breath.*** You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour at a time.

***Powerful Build.*** Your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples.

***Swim.*** You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.

***Technician.*** You are proficient in the Technology<br> skill.

***Toughness.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Herglese. Herglese has a clear and commanding cadence, drawing the attention of those who hear it.

<div style='margin-top:39px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Ho'dins are tall humanoids with multi-colored skin, naturally webbed and suction cup-tipped fingers and toes, and temperature-sensing red-violet "snake hair". Ho'dins are, on average, over nine feet tall—nearly a full head taller than wookiees. Renowned throughout the galaxy as botanists and healers, the ho'din claim an ancestry derived from the plants of their home planet, Moltok—in fact, "ho'din" translates as "walking flower" in Galactic Basic. They are, in fact, reptilian, as their natural climbing skills and cold-bloodedness seem to indicate, and boast a second heart to enhance their survivability. Their "snake hair" is temperature-sensitive, allowing ho'din to sense changes in ambient temperature.

### Society and Culture
Ho'dins are known to be self-conscious and vain, particularly when it comes to their looks and their work, and do not take criticism or insults well. Their religion, Dinante Fli'R, is centered around worshipping and communing with nature, a trait that has sent many ho'din out into the galaxy to rejuvenate damaged planets. The ho'din have an aversion to technology and avoid surface mining and manufacturing, opting instead to dwell in trees. They have learned to make incredibly advanced pharmaceuticals and gardens using their botanical skills to concoct natural medicines, some of which have cured plagues on distant worlds. The title of "Master Gardener" is one of high esteem and great respect in ho'din society.

### Names
Ho'din names are quite diverse. Some names look complicated and difficult to pronounce, while others are quite simple. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Baji, Gra'tau, Iwo, Oojoh, Thrung, Vala

**Female Names.** Chela, Kutu, Lohje, Par'tah, Sirta, Tal

**Surnames.** Alewune, Kulko, Oolos, Plett, Ustu, Wen

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:354px'></div>

### Ho'Din Traits
As a ho'din, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Ho'din reach adulthood in their early 30s and live up to 120 years.

***Alignment.*** Ho'dins' benevolent nature causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Ho'din are taller than most species, typically standing 8 to 10 feet tall and generally weighing about 275 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 

***Biological Specialists.*** You have proficiency with Medicine or Survival (your choice).

***Cold Sensitivity.*** You have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion due to extreme cold.

***Crafters.*** You have proficiency with one artisan's implements of your choice.

***Naturalist.*** You have proficiency in the Nature skill.

***Rain Forest Dweller.*** Growing up in the rain forests of Moltok has left an impact. You don't treat forest terrain as difficult terrain.

***Reptilian Senses.*** Whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check related to sensing heat, you are considered to have expertise in the Perception skill.

***Second Heart.*** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

***Treeclimber.*** You have a climbing speed of 30 feet. You have advantage on Strength saving throws and Strength (Athletics) checks that involve climbing.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic, and Ho'Din. Ho'Din consists of croaks and hisses. Its written form includes characters derived from the shapes of Moltok flora. The Ho'Din lexicon includes a great amount of plant-based idioms and metaphors.

<div style='margin-top:25px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Houk are hulking bipeds with thick skin, hairless heads marked with bony ridges and a pronounced brow, flabby jowls, beady yellow eyes, and no visible ears or nose. They are very powerful due to their large bulk of pure muscle. 

### Society and Culture
The houk have well-earned reputations as bullies, cheaters, and backstabbers. They are often compared to wookiees because of their great strength and violent disposition. Houk are humorless, short-tempered beings who use their strength to antagonize weaker beings. Their propensity for deceit and skulduggery is matched only by the hutts. Though their tempers are not as explosive as those of wookiees, houk are known for their tendency to solve problems violently. In politics, they will often wage war without formal declarations, negotiate in bad faith, and ignore treaties. Though this preference for violence tend to cause the houk problems in dealing with other societies, it often gets them what they want. Surprisingly though, in personal combat, houk prefer to use stealth rather than direct confrontation. This gives them a reputation for deceit and cowardice. However, just as each houk colony has a different culture and government, houk individuals have varied personalities. Though all houk come from a culture with high levels of corruption and violence, many houk are hard workers who have learned to get along with other sentients. The houk produce little technology of their own, though they adapt themselves to the standard technology of the rest of the galaxy. 

### Names
Houk names are gruff and primitive in nature, and don't vary by gender.

**First Names.** Agamor, Krelba, Morg, Roath

**Surnames.** Krin, Nar, Vogog, Voss

### Biology and Appearance
Hutts are a massive slug-like species who have large mouths and stubby arms. They have three lungs and thick leathery skin, which is wrinkled and slimy. Hutts often have watery eyes and lack facial expressions.  Their tails are supported by a skeletal spine.  Despite their legendary size, hutts start out as tiny huttlets less than half a foot in height, and continually grow over the long lives.

### Society and Culture
Most hutts are crime lords who live opulent lives overseeing criminal underworld activities like spice smuggling, slavery, gambling and bounty hunting. This is not true for all, however, as some eschew the life of a decadent, obese version of their species and prefer a more mobile existence. Hutt society is divided into families known as kajidics, a social structure that is both familial and a crime gang.

Hutts are encouraged to make a name for themselves around the age of 150 while simultaneously not threatening the welfare of the clan.  At around 200, they will likely stop being saved by the clan and encouraged even further to fend for themselves while benefiting the kajidic; they may even be granted a star system or two.  Nomadic or kajidic-less hutts are often hunted or killed by other hutts in fear of the nomad coming to claim a territory.

### Names
Hutt names with a suffix title as "the Hutt" are usually reserved for noteworthy huts, with the name of a hutt's kajidic coming before the title.  Because hutts are hermaphroditic, choosing a gender at will, their names are considered androgynous.

**First Names.** Arok, Gorga, Jabba, Mama, Ziro, 

**Kajidic Names.** Besadii, Desilijic, Fenn'ak, Gnuda

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:234px'></div>

### Hutt Traits
As a hutt you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.

***Age.*** Hutts are considered a child until around the age of 200 in which they are a full fledged adult.  Hutts can live upwards of 900 years with even more ancient ones exceeding that.

***Alignment.*** Hutts are selfish, greedy, and highly organized, causing them to tend toward chaotic dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Hutts have a unique special characteristic; from birth to death, they never stop growing. As an adolescent hutt, you typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh at least 400 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 20 feet.

***Closed Mind.*** Hutt brains have an unusual composition which made them resistant to influence from the Force. You have advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws against force powers.

***Natural Resistance.*** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage (explained in chapter 9).

***Powerful Build.*** Your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples.

***Prehensile Tail.*** You have supreme control over your tail and can use it to manipulate objects as well as your hands.

***Shrewd Demeanor.*** You have proficiency in two Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma skills of your choice.

***Slow and Lethargic.*** Hutts are slow and generally incapable of moving quickly. You have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and when determining your bonus to AC from your Dexterity, you can't add more than +3.

***Wealthy.*** During character creation, you start with additional credits equal to your level x your proficiency bonus x 1,000 cr.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Huttese. Hutts rarely speak Galactic Basic, even though they are perfectly able; if the person with whom they are speaking doesn't understand Huttese, they are more likely to use an interpretor than deign to speak the language of lesser species.

### Biology and Appearance
Iktotchi do not have hair, but rather they had a very resistant skin which protected them from the violent winds which crossed the satellite.

The males' horns are generally a little larger, a remnant from their mountain-dwelling, caprinaen ancestors. The horns are able to regenerate if damaged.

### Society and Culture
The Iktotchi are a fiercely guarded and isolationist species - vaunted for their ability to hide their feelings and bury any semblance of emotion. Originating on the harsh, windy moon of Iktotch, which orbits the planet Iktotchon in the Expansion Region, the Iktotch are gifted with precognition, and are courted as often by Jedi as by pirates for their skills.

Iktotchi society is a stratified society. Upward mobility is both possible and encouraged. Iktotchi are an outwardly dispassionate people, which is evidenced by their culture. They have a robust legal system, and suffer little crime. Iktotchi are respectful of cultures other than their own and can easily integrate with others.

Iktotchi who distinguish themselves often earn a titular nickname, by which they are referred to in place of their name. Generally, this is done by accomplishing a remarkable feat that benefits the Iktotchi as whole.

### Names
Iktotchi names are generally two syllables. Surnames are familial. Respected Iktotchi often adopt a nickname, which they use in place of their birth name.

**Male Names.** Dilnam, Imruth, Kashkil, Yellam

**Female Names.** Kemkal, Onyeth, Reshu, Zorlu

### Design Insights
Kalloran are an aquatic species, similar to nautolans or quarren, with excellent physical stats. I would probably build this as a close-quarters, medium armor martial character (probably fighter or maybe berserker) and take advantage of the light- and vibro-weapons that have Dexterity requirements.

<div style='margin-top:39px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Kallerans evolved from a semi-amphibious species on Kaller. Kallerans are tall and flexible; their hands and feet have three prehensile digits on each, which leeds kallerans to avoid wearing shoes or boots. The majority of kallerans have green skin patterned with distinctive black stripes. The species have dense muscles that assist them in the protection of their otherwise delicate bodies. The kalleran head is distinguished by fin-like folds on the tops and sides of their faces. These fins augment a kalleran's hearing, allowing sound to bounce back and be picked up by the two antenna crowning their head. These antenna are sensory organs that serve as olfactory and aural receptors. Kallerans have lungs adapted to breathe above water, though the majority of their respiration is done through their skin. A holdover from their amphibious past, their skin can draw oxygen in from the air and filter out carbon dioxide. Their respiratory system requires them to consume more water than other species their size to keep their skin moist and supple. Because they do not primarily breathe through their mouths, kallerans did not evolve noses.

### Society and Culture
Above all else, kalleran's value personal achievement over collective accomplishments. Because of this, the people of Kaller have never united to form great societies or participate in galactic affairs. Much of the cultural expansion on Kaller was brought by colonists, both friendly and violent, who had settled the world over the course of millennia.

### Names
Kallerans have regal sounding names, sometimes using accents on vowels, with clan-based surnames. 

**Male Names.** Gliconn, Orcas, Lávern, Seelván

**Female Names.** Cybele, Fáress, Numarin, Retesh

**Surnames.** Alash, Byssus, Estair, Lash

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

***Keen Hearing.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve hearing.

***Prehensile Feet.*** You have supreme control over your feet and can use them to manipulate objects as well as your hands.

<div style='margin-top:49px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Kaminoans' evolution from aquatic creatures in the vast oceans of Kamino is reflected in their tall shape, glassy coated eyes, near luminescent skin, and long, thin necks. The almond-shaped eyes of kaminoans are also able to see color in the ultraviolet spectrum. While female kaminoans are bald, males possess headcrests and fin ridges along the rear of their small, bulbous skulls.

### Society and Culture
The kaminoans see themselves as a superior form of life, but nevertheless remained polite to outsiders. To them any species seeking self-improvement is worthy of respect, but those who do not are obviously inferior; self-improvement has a central role in Kaminoan society. Through the development and mastery of selective breeding, genetics, and cloning, the kaminoans were able to overcome a cataclysm that pushed them to the brink of extinction. 

Kaminoans live in a caste based society, determined by the color of the kaminoan's eyes. Gray eyed individuals handle administration and are considered of the highest-level caste; middle castes had yellow eyes and handle the skilled work; and lower castes had blue eyes and perform manual labor and other menial tasks. Although it is extremely rare, kaminoans are sometimes born with green eyes. Those are viewed as genetically inferior and as a threat to the kaminoans' well ordered society and as such are exterminated shortly after birth. 

### Names
Kaminoan names typically are composed by around two syllables and a brief surname.

**Male Names.** Lama, Ni, Orun, Koa

**Female Names.** Taun, Ko, Nala, Kina

**Surnames.** Ha, Su, We, Sai, Wa

### Biology and Appearance
The amphibious Karkarodons have tall, slim bodies with webbed hands and feet. Their shark-like heads have pointed noses, gill slits, and many rows of razor-sharp teeth, which they use when attacking and eating. Karkarodons are skilled and fast swimmers. They attack by grabbing the target and used their jaws for ripping and tearing.

### Society and Culture
Karkarodons hail from the planet Karkaris, which is located in a star system neighboring the planet Mon Cala. They harbor an intense hatred for the Mon Calamari and Quarren inhabitants. The planet is almost entirely under water, and is very uninviting to non-Karkarodons. 

Karkarodon culture is a warmongering, strength-based culture. Clans often fight eachother for dominance, natural resources, and to cull the weak. Each clan on the planet has a ruling triumvirate, usually comprised of venerated warriors who rule for life. When a younger Karkarodon wants to replace one of the ruling body, they challenge them to single, mortal combat. Occasionally, the challenged may spare the life of the challenger when they win, though that usually leads to resentment from the loser.

Karkarodons do not believe in lying or duplicity. They believe in approaching problems head on and saying what they mean, and are generally demeaing towards those they deem their lessers.

### Names

### Biology and Appearance
The kiffar are very closely related to humans, enough that they can interbreed, though kiffar typically have darker hair. The biggest visual difference between the two is that the kiffar always wear tattoos, that represent their clan. Kiffar are more likely to be Force-sensitive, which is typically manifested in psychometry, a rare Force power that about one percent of the kiffar population can use. Using psychometry, kiffar can touch objects and receive visions from the Force that show them the object’s past. 

### Society and Culture
The kiffar reside on the planets of Kiffu and Kiffex. Kiffar are a people who value their own independence, staying out of galactic affairs and being ruled only by themselves. They see outsiders as dangerous and are generally nationalists. They are organized into clans, and clan heritage is very important to them. Their markings, which they call qukuuf, are passed down through the family maternally, but kiffar with a human mother will typically use their father’s tattoos. Conversely, clan membership is passed down paternally, and those with a human father can join their mother’s clan. The traditional colors of the facial tattoos are red, yellow, and green. Various patterns and designs are used to identify the clan. 

Kiffu Guardians, also known as the Guardians of Kiffu, are an important kiffar institution that acts as a police force in their space. The Kiffu Guardians wear black armor, and they share a symbol with clan Vos, which is a gold five-pointed star outlined by a circle. 

### Names
Kiffar use names similar to those of humans, varying drastically clan by clan. Surnames are familiar. 

**Male Names.** Kurros, Sathran, Vis, Ziflos

### Biology and Appearance
Killiks possess a strong chitinous exoskeleton that is glossy and greenish with their carcasses capable of surviving thousands of years of erosion as seen by the colonists of Alderaan. The exoskeleton also contains a number of spiracles which served as their way of breathing. Typically, these Human-sized hive creatures have four arms with each ending in a powerful three-fingered claw. They stand on two stout legs that are capable of leaping great distances. Killiks can communicate with other Killiks through use of pheromones.

### Society and Culture
The Killiks have a communal society, with each and every Killik being in mental contact with another. Due to their hive mind, every Killik nest is virtually one individual. Killiks are also peaceful in nature. Their telepathic connection is capable of extending to other species which includes non-insectoids. A willing creature can submit to this telepathy to become a Joiner. They effectively become another vessel of the hive mind.

Killiks lose connection to their hive mind at great distances. Those who voluntarily leave the hive mind are referred to as Leavers. It is rare that they are allowed to rejoin their hive without reason.

### Names
Killiks are a hive-mind insectoid that typically don't use names. On the offchance they do, it's usually an incomprehensible series of clicking noises. They are receptive to nicknames given by others.

Although the hutts allow a council of elders to rule on Klatooine, all off-world affairs are wholly under hutt control. Under the hutts, the klatooinians serve as soldiers and guards. Even those klatooinians who do not serve the hutts are often employed as hired muscle by other masters.

Klatooinian society was known for a strong belief in tradition and the wisdom of the elders, although some younger klatooinians rebelled against this norm and sought out freedom from enslavement. Others attempted to gain their own fortunes as smugglers, pirates, bounty hunters, or raiders.

<div style='margin-top:19px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Kubaz are distinctive for their short, prehensile facial snouts which were used for reaching insects within their hives. They have adapted to their sun-scorched, vegetation-deprived world by learning to survive off their world's native insect population. Filled with two rows of teeth for gnashing their food, the Kubaz trunk also functions as a highly sensitive nose.  Due to living on their homeworld of Kubindi—a planet which orbits a blue star—Kubaz are highly sensitive to red wavelengths; when traveling to planets with a red or yellow star, Kubaz are forced to don protective eyewear to avoid damaging their sensitive eyes.

### Society and Culture
The Kubazi society is based on a clan structure which<br> dwell in underground nests. Ruled by a queen, each<br> clan takes the name of their queen they are<br> descended from. Developing a non-verbal language of<br> hand gestures which indicated their intentions, Kubaz<br> are able to speak Galactic Basic, though with a strong<br> nasally accent.  When interacting with other species,<br> some Kubaz will share certain hand signals with non-<br>Kubaz in order to ease communications.  Obsessed<br> with tact and decorum, the Kubaz place a high<br> emphasis on the family unit and proper courtesies,<br> displaying truthfulness to a fault. Valuing art and<br> literature with such vigor as to sometimes practice<br> smuggling of great works, the Kubaz do not find such<br> pursuits to be wrong or unlawful.  Due to their diet on<br> Kubindi, the Kubaz have poor relations with sentient<br> insectile species. 

### Names
Kubaz names are usually dominated by harsher sounds, but some names lean more melodic. Surnames are clan-based.

**Male Names.** Shaf, Rizor, Duldril, Kurn, Schnaldiz

**Female Names.** Zhanro, Dizi, Tavo, Agoz, Nuzrem

**Surnames.** Re, Eadzan, Hai, Khu'nar, Mairvuc, Va

Kushibans are four-limbed lagomorphs native to the planet Kushibah. They are diminutive, unimposing, and typically weaker than most humanoids, but they are also quite difficult to track due to their natural speed and stealth.

While Kushibans are quadrupeds, their forepaws are as manipulative as traditional hands. While kushibans can walk on two legs, they typically run around on four feet since they can move significantly faster that way. 

Kushibans are inherently cute and fuzzy, and more nefarious species often attempt to take them as slaves. Kushibans are social and do not take well to slavery, and they typically don't live long in solitude or captivity. 

### Society and Culture
Kushibans live in a simple, peaceful society on the non-<br>industrialized, lush green planet of Kushibah in the Outer Rim. Kushibans are typically kind and generous, with a playful sense of humor and a penchant for practical jokes. However, if betrayed or angered, Kushibans can be cruel or vindictive, and they have little patience for bullies, simpletons, and misanthropes.

### Biology and Appearance
A lanky, bipedal humanoid species, the Kyuzo originate on the gravity-heavy Outer Rim world of Phatrong. Kyuzo are tall and slender, though their appearance belies their strength and quickness. Due to the uncommon makeup of their homeworld's atmosphere, Kyuzo frequently wear corrective lenses and a highly pressurized filter mask over their faces to protect their sensitive respiratory systems and assist them in coping with uncomfortable climates like galactic standard habitable environments. As well as causing respiratory and vision problems, exposure to such conditions causes a Kyuzo to become ill within in a short period of time, interfering with their ability to concentrate and slowing them down.

### Society and Culture
A species known for its strong sense of justice and honor, most Kyuzo regard oaths and contracts as unbreakable and many species seek them as mercenaries, law-enforcement personnel and bounty hunters. A highly political species, the Kyuzo developed societies that span considerable geographical areas, and most identify as members of a particular country or region. Most major islands and continents on Phatrong are their own political units, though they do form a loose confederacy.

### Names
Male names typically end in vowels, while female names end in consonants. Surnames are based on region.

**Male Names.** Drego, Embo, Khalu, Mhali, Zuvio

<div style='margin-top:41px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Lannik are short, bipedal humanoids with droopy, long ears. Males and females are equally tall, although the latter have a considerably less strong complexity. Their species is, however, much more vigorous and resistant than what its size could suggest. A Lannik's skin tends to be of colours similar to his or her eyes and hair. The species has evolved long pointy ears which allow them to hear better than human ears. 

### Society and Culture
The Lannik culture is apparently war loving, and Lanniks feel a great respect for warriors. At the same time, though, they follow a strict centuries-old code of honour. Lannik soldiers have the custom of tying all their hair in a single topknot over their head. Their species is one of fierce warriors, whose abilities have developed fighting against terrible predators and other Lanniks in a long history of wars. Although many regard the Lannik as hotheaded and temperamental, they are quite fearless and clear-headed even in combat, giving them the ability to think their way out of a dangerous situation.

The Lannik do not show their thoughts through their facial expressions, and seem always angry to other species. They are also very stubborn, and are not likely to change career once they chose it. Most males - and many females - serve in the planetary militia, celebrating the species' past as a warrior species. Some take on off-world mercenary work.

### Names
Lannik names are generally short. Lanniks don't often give out their surnames.

**Male Names.** Minch, Oteg, Vandar, Yaddle, Yoda

**Female Names.** Giro, Lina, Penny, Vona, Zeya

**Surnames.** Bek, Kaz, Mon, Var, Zin

### Biology and Appearance
A humanoid sentient species, Lasats are notable for their impressive height, strength, and agility, with their muscular digitigrade legs enabling them to run faster, jump higher and farther, and move more quietly than humans. Their large finger pads and prehensile toes assist them in climbing. In addition, their large eyes and ears afford them superior sight and hearing over humans. They had the strength to open a powered-down blast door. A height of two meters tall was considered below-average for a Lasat.

### Society and Culture
Lasat society is held together by a long-standing oral tradition, featuring clever and stealthy heroes. Within the species, those with fighting skills are highly respected, often being members of the Lasan High Honor Guard, a group of highly trained, highly intelligent warriors sworn to protect their homeworld<br> of Lira San. Bo-rifles are a long-standing tradition in<br> Lasat culture, used exclusively by the Honor Guard of<br> Lasan. The warrior way of the Lasat is the Boosahn<br> Keeraw. When a Lasat is bested by a superior<br> opponent in combat, they would give them their<br> weapon.

Facial hair is an important status symbol in Lasat culture. Those with green eyes and prominent purple stripes are considered to be attractive by others of<br> their species. Juvenile Lasat are noted to climb tree<br> branches. 

### Names
Lasat names tend to be melodic, with the occasionally harsh tone sprinkled in. Surnames are born by communities within Lasat culture rather than individual families.

**Male Names.** Brob, Drim, Krus, Parred, Volares

**Female Names.** Denazo, Gume, Hado, Zanisa

**Surnames.** Dragarr, Ellias, Krod, Roleb, Vuzan

<div style='margin-top:39px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Lurmen's bodies are covered entirely in fur, which range in color from a dark brown to a white-gray, though they do wear garments. They can walk either upright on their two legs, and can also use their arms and legs for faster movement. Many lurmen have the ability to roll themselves into a wheeled shape; this allows them to cover distances at great speed. They may have learned this ability from the native amani on Maridun. 

### Society and Culture
The lurmen use fallen seedpods from the giant trees as shelter and home. Living near the trees proves too dangerous, as the falling pods can be deadly. Instead, the lurmen drag the pods into a clearing and use them as huts. They also extract essential oils from the pods for nutrition and healing medicines. Most lurmen are pacifistic by nature and refuse to fight or run even in the face of death. They often will hide instead of using violence. As pacifists, they carry no weapons but carry farming tools or ropes. The greatest native threat to the lurmen are the amani and the mastiff phalones, raptor-headed quadrupeds that hunted in groups. However, even in defeating these beasts the lurmen attempt to remain true to their pacifist ideals, and not inflict any injury to the creatures. Instead, when cornered by a mastiff phalone, an agile lurmen will try to unbalance the creature by tying a rope around its stout legs. 

### Names
Lurmen names are sharp and made up of a single syllable. Instead of surnames, lurmen are granted additional names based on their importance to the village. Common lurmen possess one name, with leaders having as many as four. 

**Male Names.** Fee, Gatt, Nub, Shoo, Yup

**Female Names.** Kal, Laa, Shal, Vook, Yiit

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Natural Healer.*** You have proficiency in the Medicine and Nature skills, and the bioanalysis kit.

***Prehensile Tail and Feet.*** You have supreme control over your tail and feet and can use them to manipulate objects as well as your hands. 

***Rolling Agility.*** As a lurmen, you can run on all fours, or curl into a ball, to move quickly along the ground. When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns. 

***Treeclimber.*** You have a climbing speed of 25 feet. You have advantage on Strength saving throws and Strength (Athletics) checks that involve climbing.

<div style='margin-top:63px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The warrior caste of the sith purebloods, the massassi have genetically turned into the perfect warrior. While some looked like their sith pureblood brothers, others have more extreme physical differences, including fin-like growths, a taller form and tough skin. These imposing figures live much shorter lives than other species. They, like the few other creatures that inhabit Korriban, derive sustenance directly from the dark side of the Force, in part of a natural symbiotic relationship where sith—like the massassi—feed on the dark side, and empower it in turn. Thus the massassi have such a high rate of Force-sensitivity that they are considered a naturally Force-sensitive species.

### Society and Culture
The massassi are fearsome, ruthless, and efficient soldiers. As with the sith, war and violence are just as much a part of the natural order of life as peace or serenity for the massassi. They are not only fearsome, but both loyal and formidable warriors that are dedicated to their sith masters. Though they engage in supposedly primitive practices such as sacrifice and hold a strong caste system, their civilization is quite sophisticated. In addition to the focus on war and fighting, the massassi are also loyal and organized. Even though they are not extremely intelligent, they can be trained to carry out complex battle plans and maintain their equipment, starships, and weaponry.

### Names
Originating from the pureblood sith, massassi abominations follow many similiar naming conventions. Their names represent primitive virtues in the Sith tongue, and have no surname. 

**Males Names.** Asha, Derriphan, Hâsk, Jen, 
 
**Female Names.** Kintik, Midwan, Siqsa, Tyûk

<div style='margin-top:354px'></div>

### Massassi Traits
As a massassi, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution increases by 2, and your Strength increases by 1.

***Age.*** Massassi live relatively short lives. They reach adulthood after 14 years, and reach old age around 40 years of life.

***Alignment.*** The massassi are savage and brutish warriors who relish on the violence of combat, usually following a dark and chaotic nature.

***Size.*** Massassi are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 200 and 300 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Type.*** Your creature type is both aberration and humanoid.

***Darkvision.*** Your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Force Symbiosis.*** When you reach 3rd level, you can cast your choice of the *curse*, *dun moch*, or *hex* force power once per day. Your forcecasting ability is Charisma.

***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

***Oversized.*** Lightweapons and vibroweapons that lack the dexterity or light property are considered to have the heavy property for you. The strength number for blasters is reduced by one step (from 19 to 17, 17 to 15, 15 to 13, or 13 to 11). If the strength number is 11, you ignore it entirely.

***Powerful Build.*** Your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Sith. Sith is an agglutinative language, in which words or even phrases were made up of linear sequences of distinct meaningful units.

<div style='margin-top:40px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Mikkians are a species of brightly colored humanoids. The mikkians' most distinctive feature are their motile head-tendrils, with the number, form, and pattern varying between individuals. These head-tendrils primarily serve as sensory organs, particularly detecting sound as a replacement for an ear common in other species. Mikkian head-tendrils also could detect other information, such as humidity, temperature, magnetic direction and radiation. This radiation detection can be detected to the extent that mikkians can "see" light and dark, although their eyes are still their primary visual organs. 

### Society and Culture
Mikkians place kinship and integrity above all. In fact, their honesty can come across as blunt or even rude to other sentients. Conversely, mikkians often have trouble adjusting to the more flexible views of other races. Their complex code of honor encompass all things in life, with a particular insistance on matters of warfare. Although they respect warrior traditions, the Mikkians nevertheless value discipline and honor over victory or physical might.

Different religious traditions exist among the Mikkians, but belief in the Force plays a central role in all of them. In Mikkian society, their head-tendrils have important cultural significance, and as such tendril-reading is used by Mikkian mystics to predict their future. Every facet of the head-tendril contributes to that meaning.

### Names
Mikkian names are often short and disyllabic, with a melodic quality to them. Mikkians typically don't use surnames, though some may adopt them. 

**Male Names.** Cage, Fedlas, Mekko, Sakas 

**Female Names.** Beyra, Fenvar, Tiplee, Zelna

***Alignment.*** Mikkian's honor and integrity based culture causes them to tend toward lawful alignments, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Mikkian typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 120 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Blindsight.*** Mikkian can perceive the world around them through heat and radiation. You have blindsight out to 30 feet. If another trait would grant you blindsight, the range is increased by half as many feet.

***Keen Hearing.*** Your head-tendrils provide a keen awareness of your surroundings. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve hearing.

***Bureaucratic.*** You have proficiency with Persuasion or Intimidation (your choice).

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Mikkian. Mikkian is a melodic, flowing tongue made up of several ancient dialects.

### Biology and Appearance
The Miraluka are a near-human species that differs from Humans in that they lack eyes, only retaining vestigial eye sockets, and perceive the environment around them through *force sight* instead of regular vision. This vision is so strong that if a Miraluka looks upon a Jedi or Sith, they can "see" Force radiating off them. The strength of a Miraluka's connection to the Force varies by individual.

### Society and Culture
Miraluka are a thoughtful, cautious, and deliberative species. They have little interest in personal gain or glory. For social reasons, Miraluka hide their appearance by wearing a headband, a mask, or similar concealing headwear. In addition all Miraluka are very united by species. They call themselves "brothers" and are considered as members of a great family. As a Force-using species, Miraluka are often quite shocked if 'shown' life not connected to the Force. 

Many Miraluka worship two gods, Ashla and Bogan, through the philosophy of the Greater Force. They do not believe in good or evil, but were taught to accept both life and death.

Miraluka Force-sensitives are an order of their own called the Luka Sene. Academic in atmosphere and culture, the Luka Sene focus primarily on developing the sense-related powers of their members. However, unlike the Jedi, Sith and other traditions, the Luka Sene does not dictate a member's personal life.

### Names
Miraluka names are generally two syllables. Miraluka don't use surnames, as they believe they are one<br> family.

**Male Names.** Aakih, Pafil, Rikhor, Vociif, Xuwuth

**Female Names.** Auchaod, Favom, Mucem, Wilierth

***Alignment.*** Miraluka believe in balance and thus tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.

When you reach 5th level, you learn and can cast the *force confusion* power once per day. Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your forcecasting ability for these powers.

***Force Sight.*** Miraluka perceive the environment around them through use of the Force. You are constantly under the effects of the force power *force sight*, though the power does not require concentration for you. 

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Miralukese.

### Biology and Appearance
Mirialans are a near-human species native to the planet Mirial. They have green to yellow skin and tattoos on their faces. The Mirialans are known for their spirituality and strong connection with the world around them. Mirialans are very flexible and agile, making them fast and formidable foes.

### Society and Culture
The Mirialan people are deeply religious and practice a primitive understanding of the Force. They believe<br> each individual's actions contribute to their destiny,<br> building upon past successes and failures to drive<br> them towards their fates. Within their belief system<br> was the view that individual actions ripple through the<br> Force, also affecting the destiny of the species as a<br> whole.

A Mirialan often places a unique, geometrically repeated tattoo on their face and hands to signify that they have completed a certain test or task, or achieved sufficient aptitude for a certain skill. The number of tattoos often acts as a good indicator of how mature and/or skilled a Mirialan was. Because the more markings brings about a form of status, Mirialan society is stratified and allows the heavily marked citizens to access greater opportunities. Despite its importance, most Mirialans do not know the entirety of the tattoo lexicon due to its complexity. The interaction between placement and positioning of the shapes is incredibly subtle and changes their meaning greatly.

### Names
Mirialan names are typically concise and rarely more than two syllables. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Boca, Floha, Jemy, Puv, Choqa

**Female Names.** Buf, Ches, Kebe, Ovof, Shaqa

**Surnames.** Acave, Ishakee, Kefvi, Uflozi, Zoria

<div style='margin-top:129px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Mustafarians are an insectoid species of sentients native to the volcanic planet of Mustafar. They are divided into two subspecies: the lanky northern mustafarians, and the stocky southern mustafarians. The southern mustafarians were notable for their greater strength, making them more suited to manual labor. Both subspecies shared many traits, particularly their hardened exoskeletons and leathery skin, which acclimated them to the extreme heat of their volcanic environment.

### Society and Culture
Mustafarians evolved from arthropods living in the slightly cooler hollows within dormant volcanoes on the surface of Mustafar. As a result of such close living, mustafarian culture is isolationist by nature, though they tolerate trade with other systems. Mustafar hosts scarce minerals and rare metals, making mustafarians an invaluable trade partner.

Native mustafarians rarely take sides when galactic conflicts rage, instead preferring to keep to themselves and control their own planet. They are daunting enemies when provoked, however.

### Names
Mustafarian names are often inspired by displays of competency or bravery, such as recovering large quantities of rare minerals, or successfully taming a lava flea. Their surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Aumstrogh, Chivos, Ikt, Ulon

**Female Names.** Altoa, Hailith, Saonji, Yura

***Size.*** Mustafarians stand between 5 and 7 feet tall and weigh around 165 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. You ignore the strength property of heavy armor.

<div style='margin-top:94px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Muuns are tall, gaunt humanoids with thin bodies, long<br> limbs, and elongated hairless heads. They typically<br> have pale pink or white skin, most likely derived from<br> their propensity for staying indoors. Muuns have tiny<br> ears on the middle of the sides of their heads, flat<br> noses, and slim mouths which leads to a<br> commonly nasally voice.

### Society and Culture
Muuns believe in tradition, with an established culture based on intelligence and merit. A class-based hierarchy, Muuns consider the  the intellectual pursuits — financiers, lawyers, engineers, diplomats, scientists — as the highest levels of society. Muun culture, and life, revolves around economics and finance. Intense competition among coworkers encourages economic growth, increased productivity, and superior work ethic. Muuns also have a fundamental respect for justice, though they typically adhere to the letter of the law rather than the spirit.

Since Muuns tend to shy away from fighting and physical pursuits, Muun society relies on alternative means for their planet's protection, using vast financial resources to purchase massive floating defense platforms to defend their civilization from attack.

### Names
Muun names are typically clear and concise, rarely containing more than two syllables, with familial surnames.

**Male Names.** Clu, Hego, Nix, Pors, San

**Female Names.** Dax, Efra, Gil, Rel, Ter

**Surnames.** Card, Damask, Hill, Lesser, Tonith

<div style='margin-top:69px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Neimoidians are distant genetic relatives of the duros and retain many similarities to them, including basic form, noseless faces, and green-blue skin (though neimoidians tend to be grayer). Their eyes also have pupils that split horizontally, and they are distinguished by small lumps on their foreheads and down-turned mouths. Instead of noses, they have olfactory glands underneath their eyes. These genetic differences are attributed to the distinct features of their homeworld, Neimoidia, including its gravity, which is markedly heavier than duro.

### Society and Culture
Neimoidians spend their formative years as puny grubs in the communal hives of Neimoidia, until the age of seven standard years. They are knowingly neglected by being given limited amounts of food. This way, the weaker individuals are weeded out, while the most acquisitive grubs hoard more food than they can eat by themselves. Neimoidian education ensures the survival of the greediest. Neimoidians place tremendous value on wealth and material possessions, and would go to great lengths to gain money and power. This has resulted in a stereotype of neimoidians being greedy and cowardly. While not all neimoidians are easily intimidated, many prefer to avoid direct combat.

### Names
Neimoidian names are usually short and easy to pronounce, to make them more memorable to other species that approach them as consumers. Their surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Lok, Gap, Krinit, Mar, Nute

**Female Names.** Bu, Fia, Feza, Vissi

**Surnames.** Dod, How, Kethe, Preelli, Tuuk 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:476px'></div>

### Neimoidian Traits
As a neimoidian, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Neimoidians reach adulthood in their 20s and live about 150 years.

***Alignment.*** Neimoidians' greedy nature causes them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Neimoidians typically stand around 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 135 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Grovel, Cower, and Beg.*** As an action on your turn, you can cower pathetically to distract nearby foes. Until the end of your next turn, your allies gain advantage on attack rolls against enemies within 10 feet of you that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Smooth Talker.*** You have proficiency in Deception and Persuasion.

***Wealthy.*** During character creation, you start with additional credits equal to your level x your proficiency bonus x 1,000 cr.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Pak Pak. Pak Pak is often considered an elegant-sounding language by those who hear it. It consists of husky sighs and guttural ululations.

<div style='margin-top:35px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Nikto are reptilian humanoids that are noted for their leathery skin. They hold a limited range of facial expressions because they lack the necessary anatomical infrastructure. Their eyes are covered by a protective membrane, being a thin transparent pellicle that protects their eyes underwater and during windstorms. As a result, they are noted for their "staring" eyes and a seemingly blank expression which leads to many underestimating nikto intelligence.

### Society and Culture
Although lacking in personal charisma, nikto posses a single-minded tenacity that makes them excellent followers. Their lives made nikto cunning combatants. Most nikto are content with a life of servitude as in their eyes a life in slavery was preferable to the hardship and toil on their homeworld. Not all nikto work for the hutts though most free members of their kind were formerly enslaved. Whilst nikto are known to escape from their master, most tend to fall into service of another hutt who "inherited" them according to custom should their previous employer die. However, some escaped nikto did instead use some opportunities to genuinely become free beings. Any such emancipated nikto have to be constantly on guard as they risked capture by hutt-employed slavers who return their prey to their "rightful owners". In addition, they lacked charisma and preferred to follow orders instead of giving them. As a result, the Nikto were most identified with their Hutt masters.

### Names
Nikto names are very complex, hard to pronounce, and harsh sounding. Name length also differs a lot, longer names having apostrophes or dashes. Their names are unisex, with surnames being familiar and optional. 

**First Names.** Jydabaum, N'rok'ratu, Sussa, Vydgish

**Surnames.** Gozorc, Irtitt, Qegmarg, Umpluurg

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.

***Age.*** Nikto reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Nikto's self-sufficient and clever nature causes them to tend toward balanced alignments, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Nikto typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 150 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

***Protective Membrane.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being blinded.

***Radiation Resistant.*** The dying star nearby their homeworld makes nikto naturally used to radiation. You have resistance to necrotic damage.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic, Nikto, and Huttese. Nikto is spoken with sharp syllables with a deep and rumbling cadence.

***Adaptation.*** The frequent radiation bursts from the nearby dying star caused the nikto to mutate and adapt into different subspecies over time, specialized for different environments. Choose one of the following adaptations:

<div style='margin-top:94px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Noghri are a primitive humanoid species hailed from the planet Honoghr with steely gray-blue skin that are renowned assassins. A natural gift for stealth and<br> hand-to-hand combat, Noghri are efficient killing<br> machines with their rending claws and strong olfactory<br> sense that can often determine familial lineage. Their smaller size belies their ruthlessness and potent<br> hunting skills.

### Society and Culture
Noghri culture relies heavily on honor, with society being clan-based, revolving around the Dukha, a community center in each village. The greatest strength of the Noghri stems from their loyalty and secrecy; when a Noghri takes a job, they always fulfill it, even if it would result in their death. As such, they make exceptional, albeit expensive bodyguards.

Noghri are loathe to fight with weapons larger than small daggers, believing combat to be a personal celebration to be sullied by use of heavier weapons. As such, it is rare (though not impossible) to see a Noghri wielding a weapon larger than their forearm.

Each Noghri clan village centers around the Dukha, with each clan being led by a Dynast. The Dukha is inhabited by the clan's Maitrakh, who functions as the storyteller, spiritual leader, and lore keep of the clan.

### Names
Noghri names vary from short to long, with female names being typically softer. Surnames are clan-based.

**Male Names.** Cakhmaim, Ezrakh, Khabarakh, Rukh

**Female Names.** Cilnaas, Edvir, Kahr'corvh, Meewalh

**Surnames.** Bakh'tor, Eikh'mir, Hakh'khar, Khim'bar

***Strong-Legged.*** When you make a long jump, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Strength score. When you make a high jump, you can leap a number of feet up into the air equal to 3 + twice your Strength modifier.

### Biology and Appearance
Near-humans possessing golden, flaky skin, nothoiins feature fair to brown hair with brown eyes and typically have physical heights and builds common to humans.  Nothoiins' appearance has earned their species the nickname of "Goldskins."

### Society and Culture
Although nothoiins hail from their eponymous homeworld and star system in the Anoat Sector, they are ubiquitous throughout the Greater Javin Region and Corporate Sectors.  Their history of interstellar exploration and colonization was facilitated by their species' natural spacefaring abilities in both piloting and navigation and necessitated by their home planet's periodically harsh, dry climate.  Droughts on Nothoiin can last for decades, and the wildfires they foster have served as one of the primary factors behind the limited development of the planet's economy beyond the ur-diamond mining industry, which produces the system's chief export.  

Large-scale emigration from Nothoiin has led members of its native species to seek careers as pilots, navigators, and operatives in numerous criminal enterprises.  Various nothoiin colonies have given rise to a number of different governmental systems running the gamut from representative democracies to autocracies.

### Names
Nothoiin typically receive a gendered given name and a familial surname.

**Male Names.** Amrosio, Jado, Kosimas, Troov

**Female Names.** Elayah, Giranti, Lorinah, Sil

**Surnames.** Caban, Mordu, Plintus, Starstrider

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

***Age.***  Nothoiin reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Nothoiins tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.

***Size.*** Nothoiins typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh 150 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Born Pilots.*** Nothoiins demonstrate seemingly innate piloting abilities from a very young age.  You have proficiency in the Piloting skill.

***Expert Navigators.*** You are considered to have expertise in Wisdom (Survival) checks made to navigate.

***Galactic Traveler.*** You have proficiency in the Lore skill.

***Heightened Reflexes.*** Whenever you make a Dexterity ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can choose to add 1d4 to the result. You can use this before or after the roll, but before the GM determines the roll's outcome. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

***Major Miners.*** Nothoiins have intimate knowledge of ur-diamond mining and refinement practices.  You gain proficiency in your choice of jeweler's implements, scavenging kit, or archaeologist kit.

***Starship Specialists.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (Technology) check related to starships, you are considered to have expertise in the Technology skill.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and one language of your choice. You can also communicate via Notho, a native hand language developed by hunters living in the Nothoiin plains.  Usage of Notho is exceedingly rare outside Nothoiin culture.

<div style='margin-top:25px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Ortolans are squat, heavily-built humanoid bipeds with long, trunklike noses and beady black eyes. They possess floppy ears, which are extremely sensitive to sound waves. They have two hands, each ending in<br> four chubby fingers and a thumb, which is not<br> opposable. A thick, baggy hide covered in fuzz<br> resembling velvet hangs off of the Ortolan body.<br> Ortolans have a keen sense of smell to help them<br> forage for food. In fact, they are handicapped in their<br> business affairs by their attachment to food,<br> sometimes accepting otherwise unfavorable contracts<br> when promised enough to eat. Their twin obsessions<br> are food and music; offworld, many Ortolans find<br> success as chefs or musicians. 

### Society and Culture
Ortolan society is reasonably industrialised, though not as technologically advanced as other species. Despite this, their economy is mostly based on barter, with credits primarily used to trade with offworlders. Education is the responsibility of their parents, though gifted youngsters are often traded to other families to get specialized education. 

While most Ortolans appear to have blue skin, Ortolans are actually covered in short velvety fur which they often dyed in bright colors, most often blue and pink.  This tradition began when a Devaronian trader tried to sell Ortolans a shipment of food dyes—they considered dyeing their food a waste of time, but found dyed fur to be quite stylish.

### Names
Ortolan names are generally short with big sounds. Female names are typically softer. Surnames are familial.

**Male names.** Donmb, Hegh, Nax, Parm, Teeb

**Female names.** Bedla, Folfe, Nelni, Phoff, Sallo

**Surnames.** Bigek, Lubum, Nad, Rojool, Somo 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:355px'></div>

### Ortolan Traits
As an ortolan, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by<br> 1.

***Age.*** Ortolans are considered adults at the age of seven and typically live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Ortolans' love of food and music causes them to tend toward chaotic light side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Ortolans stand around 3 to 4 feet tall and weigh about 55 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Foragers.*** Whenever you make a Wisdom (Survival) check to forage for food you are considered to have expertise in the Survival skill.

***Grovel, Cower, and Beg.*** As an action on your turn, you can cower pathetically to distract nearby foes. Until the end of your next turn, your allies gain advantage on attack rolls against enemies within 10 feet of you that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Hide.*** Your thick hide is naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve hearing or smell.

***Musical.*** You have proficiency in Performance and one musical instrument of your choice.

***Undersized.*** Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons. You can't use heavy shields. Additionally, you can't use martial weapons with the two-handed property unless it also has the light property, and if a martial weapon has the versatile property, you can only wield it in two hands.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Ortolan. Ortolan is characterized by its grunts and hoots.

<div style='margin-top:68px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The pa'lowick are a species of humanoid amphibians who live in the coastal salt marshes of Lowick. They have compact but rotund midsections that top a pair of long, spindly legs ending in anisodactylic feet—three toes pointing forward, one back. This configuration, combined with their powerful lungs, enabled them to swim.

The most prominent feature of pa'lowick physiology is their prehensile snout, which ends in a pair of pouty, human-like lips. Pa'lowick are also born with sharp tusks, which some lose by middle age.

### Society and Culture
Pa'lowick live in large, independent communities with a feudal system of government. Many pa'lowick become fishers or hunters, as their biology allows. 

Songs and stories are the most treasured aspect of pa'lowick culture. Pa'lowick music runs the gamut of genres and subjects, although religious music is particularly common. Cultural heritage, such as history, genealogy, and parables, is largely passed down orally. Every Pa'lowick community has a dedicated storyteller; the esteem afforded this individual makes the position a coveted one. Large lungs make the Pa'lowick hearty singers and affords at least some members of the species the ability to scream loudly and disarm opponents in combat.

### Names
Pa'lowick names tend to grow longer as the family tree grows older, with each generation adding a few syllables they are fond of.

**Male Names.** Loran, Jelanto, Neeamesh, Samoos

**Female Names.** Larisselle, Rensilla, Sy, Tripika

**Surnames.** Chatrunis, Dym, Geeci, Snootles

<div style='margin-top:62px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Pantorans are a sentient species native to Pantora, a moon orbiting the planet Orto Plutonia. At first glance, they only differ from the otherwise similar humans in their blue skin and yellow eyes. The pantorans share many traits with other blue-skinned races, especially the wroonians, and, to a lesser extent, the chiss. The pantorans also seem to have a greater resilience to low temperatures than humans, since they only needed light wardrobe even under extreme cold weather conditions. 

### Society and Culture
Pantoran society developed on Pantora, a world located in a region flush with slavers and spice merchants. Constant run-ins with these types led the pantorans to become fiercely independent and proud. While the pantoran society is democratic, the feudal traditions of marking their foreheads, and cheeks with yellow markings to symbolize lineage persists into the common era. These traditions spurred a cultural interest in genealogy and history, and many pantorans cherish relics from the past such as jewelry which connect them to their noble ancestors or helmets that belonged to great heroes of a bygone age. The old nation states of Pantora are unified under a democratic planetary government, the politics of which are considered an art form. Governed by the Pantoran Assembly, the elected body is led by a Speaker, who balance the power of the chief executive officer, known as the Chairman. 
### Names
Pantoran use sophisticated names with numerous vowels, though often sound similar human names. 

**Male Names.** Charl, Ikurrece, Maatsu, Pulengo

**Female Names.** Freyu, Jicelli, Nandia, Suya

**Surnames.** Ipujarero, Molidias, Tuteru, Vagana

<div style='margin-top:339px'></div>

### Pantoran Traits
As a pantoran, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Intelligence or Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Pantorans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Pantorans' interest in politics causes them to tend towards lawful alignments, though there are exceptions. 

***Size.*** Pantorans typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 150 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Cold Adaptation.*** You have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion due to extreme cold.

***Cultured.*** You have proficiency in the Lore skill.

***Impose Order.*** As a bonus action, you can command each ally within 15 feet of you to move up to half that ally's speed as a reaction. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Negotiators.*** You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks meant to negotiate terms or agreements between parties.

***Political Guile.*** You are proficient in Persuasion or Deception (your choice). 

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Pantoran. Pantoran comprises many dialects that prevent clear communication, a vestige of the feudal culture of the planet's past.

<div style='margin-top:38px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Patrolians are fish-like in appearance, covered in pale, pastel-colored scales and possessing numerous fins on their long limbs and face, as well as a notable dorsal fin which often require modified clothing to accommodate. 

Thanks to their gills, patrolians are perfectly comfortable breathing underwater as well as on land, and their physiology is also notoriously resistant to electric shocks—both likely throwbacks to evolution on their native homeworld of Patrolia.

### Society and Culture
Patrolians are a notably innovative and resourceful species, and many of their number have found their way into roles in the construction, maintenance and sale of technology. 

Unfortunately, patrolians tend to pursue these businesses in a shady manner, and most tend to operate such ventures in the criminal underworld, working as bounty hunters, thieves, fences, slicers and other such technically-demanding criminal roles. 

This inclination towards crime stems from their homeworld, which is perpetually stalled in a state of economic decay due to wartime. With the advent of multiple wars fought in the system, different armies continue to see the aquatic world as a strategic bulwark in the region. Because of this, patrolians have to find work not only off-world, but typically in fields not falling under governmental purview; unfortunately, criminal activities are the most common path. 

### Names
Patrolian names are usually multisyllabic and sing-songy with lots of open vowels and few fricatives. Patrolians are not known to use family names or other surnames.

**Male Names.** Dalladu, Feddi, Nogagai, Teconica

**Female Names.** Kakeda, Machibido, Rinimma, Talla

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity or Charisma score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Patrolians reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Patrolians' greedy, scheming nature causes them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Patrolians typically stand just over 3 feet tall and generally weigh about 40 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Amphibious.*** You can breathe air and water.

***Conniving.*** You have proficiency in Deception or Stealth (your choice). 

***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to life underwater, you have superior vision in low light conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Electrical Resistance.*** Patrolians are notably capable of shrugging off electricity. You have resistance to lightning damage.

***Specialist.*** You have proficiency in one specialist's kit of your choice.

***Swim.*** You have a swimming speed of 25 feet.

***Technician.*** You are proficient in the Technology skill.

Additionally, you can't use martial weapons with the two-handed property unless it also has the light property, and if a martial weapon has the versatile property, you can only wield it in two hands.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Patrolian. Patrolian is a high-energy language, consisting mostly of gurgles and skittish vocalizations. Patrolian, even when spoken on land, sounds like it's being spoken underwater.

<div style='margin-top:55px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Pau'ans have large, sunken black eyes in red eye sockets and jagged, fang-like teeth used for tearing into raw meat, as they are carnivores. The species has pale, wrinkled skin, due to the fact that they lived in the sinkholes of Utapau, giving them limited access to light. These traits cause some to view them as frightening. However, Pau'ans as a society are generally friendly, and are happy to welcome guests to their often overlooked world. Pau'ans have long lifespans, living up to 700 years, much longer than the Utai. This earned them the nickname of "Ancients".

### Society and Culture
Pau'ans fulfill most of the governmental and administrative duties on Utapau, as the utai do not desire such work, serving as laborers instead. Most pau'ans served as leaders early in their lives, often managing teams of Utai laborers. This gives them experience that will be used later in their lives. Pau'ans are kind leaders, and sympathetic to their subordinates. Each city on Utapau is controlled by a Master of Port Administration, a hereditary title reserved for pau'ans. These administrators are assisted by advisory councils for making important decisions about their city, and each administrator serves on the Utapauan Committee and oversees planetary governance. However, the committee rarely makes crucial decisions, as the cities are able to function on their own most of the time.

### Names
Pau'an names are fairly simple, and generally melodic. Surnames are familial. 

**Male Names.** Kernul, Sivrol, Tar, Vizun, Yal, Zeolbud

**Female Names.** Cas, Jevoh, Nesim, Sizil, Ten, Yofan

**Surnames.** Gesat, Kluneln, Nom, Vley, Voy, Zet

***Alignment.*** Pau'ans' commanding presence, yet friendly and kind nature, cause them to tend to be lawful light side, though there are exceptions.

***Hypersensitive Hearing.*** Pau'ans possess incredibly receptive hearing, often to their detriment, so you wear special covers on your ears. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check involving hearing, you are considered to have expertise in the Perception skill, but if your hearing aids are removed, you have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deal sonic damage.

***Vigilant.*** You can choose to have advantage on your next Initiative check. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Utapese. Utapese is characterized by its rigid, yet melodic sound.

The pyke homeworld serves as the headquarters of the Pyke Syndicate, a criminal dealership within the Spice Cartel that operates in the criminal underworld distributing spice, an illicit substance harvested by slaves in the spice mines of the planet Kessel. To deliver spice to their customers, such as crime families on Coruscant, the Pyke Syndicate relies on smugglers and freighter captains to complete the dangerous Kessel Run. The Pyke Syndicate almost completely controls the production of raw spice in the galaxy, while maintaining tentative alliances with other criminal organizations throughout the galaxy, such as the Black Sun and the Crimson Dawn.

The Quarren are conservative and practical in their thinking, yet they reminisce more than they look to the future. The Quarren are isolationist, preferring to stay in the depths of the oceans of their homeworld. However, some Quarren make their living in the galaxy as business managers and accountants. The Quarren diligently mine metal ore from the deepest parts of the ocean, where they live deep beneath the waves. Their cities stretch far below the surface.

<div style='margin-top:62px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Created by arkanian scientists from the DNA of the xexto species, the quermians were designed to be taller than their fore-bearers and were left to evolve without any predators on their terraformed garden homeworld. Equipped with long necks for peering over vegetation mats, bulbous heads with a permanently bemused smile, and two sets of spindly arms, they also have two brains, one located in the chest cavity. Their two brains can cause mental problems when each brain developed a different personality, but also gives them a type of "telepathy" which they attribute to an ability to better observe and understand body language. Possessing no noses, the olfactory glands of this species are found in the hands.

### Society and Culture
Quermians are a gentle, unassuming people. They embrace reason, shun violence, and enjoy interacting with members of other species and cultures. A peaceful society developed on Quermia without arkanian interference, as the quermians evolved on their own in the absence of any predators or outside intervention. As a race they are dedicated to complex philosophical ideas, and many of the galaxy's most prominent diplomats and thinkers are found among their ranks. While they have four arms and are capable of using both sets with ease, they prefer to keep the lower set hidden beneath their robes when dealing with offworlders.

### Names
Quermian names are usually one to three syllables long, featuring hard or soft consonants.

**Male Names.** Murk, Koa, Jedoo, Vinian 

**Female Names.** Gouren, Kindee, Meroo, Kiaa  

**Surnames.** Kreen, Lundi, Raelo, Bactra

***Two Brains.*** When you make a Wisdom saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain advantage on the roll. Once you've done so, you must complete a short or long rest before you can do so again.

***Watchful.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Quermian. You can also communicate with other quermians more effectively through a thorough understanding of body language that xenobiologists widely attribute to latent telepathy.

<div style='margin-top:55px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
In appearance, rakata are smooth skinned amphibian-like humanoids that had tall craniums along with eyes that protruded from each side of their heads on short stalks. These bipedal beings have three digit hands that are tipped with claws for digging through packed dirt. As a species, they are uniformly lean and tall; while most rakata have a similar height and weight, females tend to be more slender than males, though just as tall. Rakata are primarily carnivorous, likely stemming from the fact that they are cannibalistic, often making a meal of other species.

Long term abuse of the Force in their society, exacerbated by a plague, culled the rakata's ability to sense the Force.

### Society and Culture
Rakatan technology and structures hold the unique property of blending with the Force, creating powerful and long-lasting monuments that are almost impossibly to replicate. Rakatan society is devoted to conquering and enslaving those they deem weak. At the height of its power, the Rakatan Infinite Empire had conquered and enslaved dozens of worlds. They would strip entire planets of their resources and then terraform them to fit their own needs.

After a plague ravaged their civilization and caused the fall of the Infinite Empire, rakata broke off into smaller tribes rather than a unified organization. Despite their newfound tribal nature, rakata retained their ability to quickly adapt to and appropriate technology.

### Names
Rakatan names do not distinguish by gender, and they do not use surnames.

**Names.** Ceh'let, Orsaa, Skal'nas, Soa, Tul'kar

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Rakata reach adulthoood by 20 and rarely live longer than 90 years.

***Alignment.*** Rakata's propensity towards war and aggression cause them to tend toward lawful dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Rakata typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh around 180 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Adaptive Resilience.*** Prolongued use of technology allows rakata to readily adapt to its effects. You have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws against tech powers.

<div style='margin-top:65px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The Rattataki are a near-human species characterized by their nimble movements, chalk-white skin and oft-bald heads. Virtually isolated from the rest of the galaxy, the Rattataki developed a violent society on their home planet of Rattatak, which involves extensive gladiatorial combat. 

### Society and Culture
While most other inhabitants of Rattatak came from the Unknown Regions, there are a significant number of off-worlder mercenaries who come to Rattatak from time to time, likely to view or participate in gladiatorial combat, only to be stranded there permanently. The remarkably harsh conditions on the planet nearly drove its population to extinction. For eons, the Rattataki constantly battled amongst themselves and their fellow inhabitants (represented primarily by Humans, Zabraks, Siniteens, Vollick, and Weequay) over the planet's limited resources. Despite being nearly completely isolated from the outside galaxy, the Rattataki displayed remarkable initiative and continually created new ways to kill each other.

Rattataki culture is bloody and unforgiving. Punishment for even the smallest crimes is unnecessarily harsh, which does little to quell that behavior. In fact, Rattataki who are known to commit crimes without being caught are celebrated.

### Names
Rattataki names are harsh sounding and short. Surnames are familial, though many Rattataki abandon them in favor of self-aggrandizing titles.

**Male Names.** Aidus, Charnagus, Karok, Veran

**Female Names.** Amaran, Kassien, Silas, Sraja, Vol

**Surnames.** Anjek, Danvik, Degger, Kolla, Venkorr

<div style='margin-top:41px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Rishii are a sentient, avian species of carnivores which possess two legs ending in four-toed feet, two arms, a tail, and a head. The species' two arms consist of feathered wings ending in nimble humanoid hands, capable of manipulating tools. The wings grant the Rishii the ability to fly at great speeds, which is their method of travel equivalent to running in land-based species. A Rishii's head contained a beak between two yellow eyes framed by a large brow. Rishii were capable of mimicking anything said to them perfectly, and also possessed extremely strong senses, particularly hearing and sight. 

### Society and Culture
Native to the planet Rishi, the Rishii live in loose primitive tribes, known as nests, clustered high upon the planet's mountains, away from the hot and humid lowland swamps. Each nest consists of a small number of family units led by a chieftain, with neighbouring nests respecting each others territories and living in harmony. This peaceful and accepting attitude goes beyond just other Rishii and was extended to all neighbours of a nest, including the many other species who colonise the lowlands of Rishi. Due to the unfavorable conditions found in the lowlands, the native avians do not understand the off-worlders' choice to live there, but were not opposed to their presence.

### Names
As with much of their speech, Rishii names include clicks, trills, and whistles to the point that other peoples have a difficult time pronouncing them. Typically, a name has two to four syllables with the sounds acting as connectors. Rishii names do not vary based on gender. Rishii are responsive to nicknames given by outsiders. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:506px'></div>

### Rishii Traits
As a rishii, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Rishii reach adulthood at 10 and generally live no longer than 60 years.

***Alignment.*** Rishii tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.

***Size.*** Rishii range from 4 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh less than 130 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Flight.*** You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. While wearing medium or heavy armor, your flying speed is reduced by half.

***Keen Hearing and Sight.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or sight.

***Mimicry.*** You can mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds you make can tell they are imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by your Charisma (Deception) check.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Rishii. Rishii's clicks, trills, and whistles are difficult for outsiders to learn without the aid of a protocol droid, and so Rishii often feel comfortable speaking to eachother in the language in front of others.

### Biology and Appearance
Their homeworld long lost from memory and time, the ryn are a humanoid race of musicians, vagabonds and travelers. The ryn's bodies are covered in soft, short fur, with a head of white hair which is matched by a tuft of hair at the end of their long prehensile tails, excellent for grasping things. Very uniquely ryn in nature, are their beak-like noses that contain fluted holes. These holes allow the ryn to play their 'beaks' like flutes. This talent has been used to communicate between ryn and has uniquely been observed in communication with droids.

### Society and Culture
Wanderlust consumes the ryn. The ryn are a nomadic species, their original homeworld forgotten, even to them. They cannot abide confinement and constraint, and they itch to move on shortly after they arrive in a new place. Due to their homelessness, musical talent, natural secrecy, and avoidance of written records, ryn developed a nomadic culture and a reputation for confidence games, leaving many species prejudiced against them. In some sectors it is legal to enslave or hunt ryn. Their language is outlawed in many locations, and a large number of ryn women are used as slave breeding stock. They claim that sabaac, the popular card game that took the place of Pazaak in terms of card game prominence, is derived from their use of it as a fortune telling tool in their auguries. These auguries are today favored by hutts, who have a superstitious belief in the card tellings. A peculiar habit is that a ryn cannot sleep in the same location twice.

### Names
Ryn names have a very melodic tone, taking cues from many different languages from across the galaxy. Ryn do not use surnames.

**Male Names.** Corfat, Dirygat, Garya, Nemagary

**Female Names.** Cogesama, Giani, Gypopha, Simeti

<div style='margin-top:21px'></div>

### Biology & Appearance
The Selkath are an aquatic species, known for being skilled swimmers and diplomats. Their heads resemble sting rays and they have a blue, pink, or green skin naturally patterned as an underwater camouflage. Their mouths are bracketed by cephalic lobes. Female Selkath differed from males due to the presence of tendrils on the back of their heads.

All members of the Selkath race have rectractable, venom-tipped claws. The use of these claws in any form of combat or attack was considered dishonorable and a sign of madness; to do this was to give in to animal instincts unbecoming of a sentient species. Because of the Selkath's water-dwelling nature, their chest armors were fitted with misting vents in order to keep their skin moist.

### Society & Culture
Selkath are native to the planet Manaan, the only naturally occurring source of the medical liquid referred to as kolto. The Selkath have leveraged this monopoly on maintain their neutrality, peddling their invaluable healing supplies to all comers.

Manaan is an ocean planet is home to only one above-surface settlement, the floating Ahto City, built directly above Hrakert Rift, the most abundant source of kolto on Manaan.  As bacta began to replace the inferior kolto on the galactic stage, Manaan fell from their previously respected position, shirking away their previous prestige and causing many Selkath to disappear from the galactic eye into isolationism and tribalism. 

### Names
Selkath names tend to have a flowing quality to it, like a stream of water. They rarely use surnames.

### Biology and Appearance
The selonians are carnivores who are believed to have descended from aquatic mammals. Their bodies are covered by a sleek fur and they normally do not wear clothing. However, when working or visiting offworld, they wear appropriate outfits. Their long bodies are equally comfortable walking on either two or four legs. Their long tails serve as a counterbalance for their bodies when standing upright. These tails are equally capable of being used as potent bludgeoning weapons in combat. At the end of their paw-like hands are retractable claws which not only gives them the capacity to dig but also makes them excellent climbers. They have long pointed faces with bristly whiskers as well as long teeth. Most selonians born are infertile females. One in every hundred are male, and one in every five hundred are fertile females.

### Society and Culture
Despite the massive starship traffic to Corellia, many visitors and even native Corellians know very little of the selonians and their distinctive unique alien culture. In mindset, they are a thoroughly grounded and serious race who are primarily concerned with the safety of their people. This means that the protection of their family dens and their species as a whole was a chief concern. The basis for this line of thinking is because they viewed that the needs of the society outweighed the needs of the individual. To those unaware of the deeper intricacies of the race, the selonians appear as an outgoing, friendly and charitable species. However, their interests rarely go beyond securing the good of their respective den.

### Names
Selonian use punctual names with no surnames.

### Biology and Appearance
Shistavanen have pronounced muzzles, sharp claws, long pointed teeth, and pointed ears set on top of their heads. Shistavanen also possess large glowing eyes, and can also run at high speeds for long periods without getting tired, alternately using two or four limbs. As predators, they possess keen hearing and smell and excellent night vision.

### Society and Culture
As a species, the Shistavanen are isolationists. The species colonized all the unpopulated worlds in the Uvena system to prevent them from being settled by non-Shistavanen, and their restrictive trade laws (which are unapologetic in how they favor their own kind over off-world traders).  Most of their society uses<br> technology similar to the rest of the galaxy, though<br> some parts of Uvena Prime use slightly less<br> sophisticated technology.

A minority of Shistavanen are more outgoing, and travel the galaxy's hyperlanes. Even these Shistavanen usually remain by themselves or with other Shistavanen. Due to their natural predatory instincts, Shistavanen commonly find employment as scouts, mercenaries and bounty hunters. Many other species react badly to Shistavanen, since their isolationist culture makes them an unfamiliar sight, and their predatory appearance put other species on edge.

### Names
Shistavanen first names typically sound graceful, while their surnames are more gutteral. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Bustuc, Hulvav, Kembol, Nemdav, Sirul

**Female Names.** Gaeft, Laer, Recloz, Shaalir, Thovnim

***Alignment.*** Shistavanen are private and tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.

***Size.*** Shistavanen typically stand around 6 feet tall and weigh between 140 and 190 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve hearing or smell.

***Regenerative.*** When you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend a Hit Die to regain hit points as long as the damage would not reduce your hit points to 0.

***Tooth and Nail.*** Your fangs and claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 kinetic damage.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Shistavanen. The Shistavanen language is characterized by its barks and growls.

<div style='margin-top:25px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Squibs are small, sentient, humanoid mammals with both rodent and canine characteristics. Their pink skin is covered in fur that offers some protection from cold weather, but, more importantly, it serves as an<br> olfactory organ, able to pick up scents at a distance<br> and ascertain intrinsic details—such as penetrating<br> through a disguise or identifying a forgery—when<br> rubbed against. The species has both male and female<br> sexes, although non-Squibs often have difficulty<br> determining the sex of a Squib based on appearance<br> alone. Their mouths are full of forbidding, sharp, white<br> teeth, and their flexible cheeks were capable of storing<br> items.

### Society and Culture
Squibs are friendly and cheerful to such an extent that, over time, they are considered quite annoying. Squibs are inherently curious, handling items with little regard to care. They are unabashed pack rats, and they wear clothing for the excess storage rather than necessity. The Squibs' overconfidence is a defining trait. The typical Squib response to a threat is not to fight or flee, but to bluff and bluster, especially when not face-to-face. In person, their sharp teeth are their favored means of intimidation. Squibs believe that bargaining is the highest form of communication, and they believe haggling is more important than the goods themselves. A deal is a binding oath to Squibs, and they are incredibly loyal to their business partners.

### Names
Squibs combine their first and last names, which are familial, into one long, hyphenated name. They often go by nicknames derived from their full names. Male and female names do not significantly deviate.

**Full Names.** Galaneever-marmalios, Meelawin-demort, Sleerinwilpher-remalior

**Nicknames.** Galan, Meela, Wilpher

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:234px'></div>

### Squib Traits
As a squib, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Squibs reach adulthood at nine years of age and live an average of sixty-five years.

***Alignment.*** Squibs' cheerful nature causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Squibs typically stand 3 to 3 and a half feet tall and weigh around 50 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Bite.*** Your sharp teeth are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage.

***Business Savvy.*** A common trait of all Squibs is their desire and love of haggling. Squibs believe a deal is done when both sides believe they got the better of the other. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check involving haggling you are considered to have expertise in the Persuasion skill.

<div style='margin-top:55px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Ssi-ruuk are a predatory, warm-blooded saurian species gifted with ferocious strength, remarkable speed, and sharp fangs and claws, traits that serve them well in the volcanic jungles of their homeworld of Lwhekk. Their muscular forms combined with their powerful tails make them very agile hunters, and their colorfully-scaled hides have been proven to be resistant even to blaster bolts. From their nostrils, two scent-tongues protrude that grant them enhanced olfactory senses, compensating for the poor vision afforded them by their dark, three-lidded eyes. No Ssi-ruu has ever been known to be Force-sensitive.

### Society and Culture
The citizens of the Ssi-ruuvi Imperium follow a rigid caste system in which their station in society is determined by the color of the scales they are born with. Among these, the brown-scaled outcasts are regarded as the lowest of the low, and have no place in the Imperium beyond menial labor or death at birth. Deeply xenophobic and religious, the Ssi-ruuk view the rest of the galaxy as populated by lesser beings whose worlds rightfully belong to the Imperium. Despite their fierce nature, most ssi-ruuk are afraid of dying on a world unconsecrated by their priest caste, as they believe their souls would be doomed, so they harvest and "entech" the life-energy of other species to power droids that fight for them. The entechment process is torturous and painful to its victims, and is the main power source of Ssi-ruuvi technology.

### Names
Ssi-ruuvi names are difficult to pronounce and gender neutral. Many ssi-ruuk adopt nicknames to make the lives of their associates easier. Ssi-ruuk do not have surnames.

**Names.** Firwirrung, Ivpikkis, Sh'tk'ith, Th'twirirl, Yifaii

### Biology and Appearance
A diminutive species of near-humans, Sullustans bear round, tapered skulls. Sullustans are distinguishable for their almond-shaped black eyes, facial jowls called dewflaps and large, round ears. Their wide earlobes provide excellent hearing, and their large eyes provide exceptional low-light vision. Due to their relative lack of exposure to natural light, Sullustans begin to suffer from corneal defects after 30 standard years. Many choose to wear special visors to prevent further damage. Some Sullustans tattoo their heads as a form of individual expression.

### Society and Culture
Sullustans are outgoing and mercantile, friendly and pragmatic. As a species they are altogether lacking in xenophobia. Though fond of practical jokes and extremely shrewd in their business dealings, they are eager to explore and travel the galaxy. Inquisitive by nature, some have described Sullustans as reckless, especially for their preference to learn and discover whenever possible through personal experience. Sullustans organize themselves into familial units known as Warren-clans. Each clan consists of one polyandrous female, several husbands, and their young. Unmated females, known as "Fems", are active members of their communities until they reach breeding status, called "Ready", when they choose their mates.

### Names
Male names are typically longer than female names. Surnames are based on Warren-clan.

**Male Names.** Duedt, Oshror, Partheen, Throthinnitz

**Female Names.** Asulu, Eldo, Tri, Vo, We

**Surnames.** Frovarr, Jeard, Plonr, Tsah, Vhiibb

<div style='margin-top:50px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Talz are large, bulky, bipedal creatures, that are covered head to toe in thick white fur, which provides exceptional insulation against their frozen world. Talz have four eyes, which are also adaptations to their native environment. The larger set of eyes are shut during the day, when sunlight reflects off the snow with dazzling brightness—able to blind sensitive optical organs—leaving the smaller set to navigate with. Alternatively, during the deep darkness of their homeworld's moonless night, the larger pair are utilized to provide the Talz with adequate vision. Talz use a small proboscis to eat and communicate, creating high-pitched chirps and buzzes.

### Society and Culture
Talz are a hunter-gatherer, clan-based society. They work in unison, and treat the entire clan as one single familial entity. Resources on Ordo Plutonia are often scarce, which leads to warring among Talz tribes. However, the clans are adept at forming a unified front when they face a common enemy.

Talz are large, brutal creatures and are often used as guards and enforcers. Sometimes they are taken as slaves, though it's rare; they are rebellious against authority and don't take well to slavery. There are rumors that Talz are captured for scientific experimentation.

### Names
Talz names are fairly gutteral and are characterized by their harsh nature. Female names are typically longer than male names. Surnames are clan-based, though it's rare that a Talz shares them with non-Talz.

**Male Names.** Drak, Fedirk, Imom, Ke, Twift

**Female Names.** Ilnuno, Ontuga, Utrukk, Zimtucc

**Surnames.** Dic, Noetoc, Suptat, Wume, Zapak

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score<br> increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases<br> by 1.

***Age.*** Talz reach adulthood at 10 and rarely live longer than 50 years.

***Alignment.*** Talz' peaceful and slow-to-anger nature cause them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Talz stand between 6 and 8 feet tall and weigh around 250 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, your thick hide is naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

***Long-Limbed.*** When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Talzzi. You can understand spoken and written Galactic Basic, but your vocal cords do not allow you to speak it. Talzzi is characterized by its high-pitched chirps and buzzes.

<div style='margin-top:40px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Tarasins are tall reptilians covered in translucent scales that allows the species' color-changing skin below to show through. Tarasins also have a colorful fan of flesh and scales—known as a kampo—that opens around their heads when they experience strong emotional distress, which can be a detriment to negotiations, as it is difficult for a tarasin to hide discomfort. This color-changing ability is useful for camouflage and communication, and the scales naturally repel heat. Some examples of colors they take on include being brown when calm and in a comfortable environment, or becoming red after extended exertion or when excited. Tarasins also have short spines that protrude from their forearms—known as a sa'tosin—which give the creatures the ability to sense the use of the Force. Tarasins are naturally curious and protective but also slow to anger. What they lack in sheer physical strength they make up for with a brilliant intellect.

### Society and Culture
Tarasins live in a tribal system in the jungle underbrush of Cularin, grouping together in clans called irstat. The tarasin believe they have a symbiotic relationship with Cularin, and their religion is based around the appreciation of the natural world. This closeness with their homeworld is what makes the tarasin reluctant to leave it for an extended time. The tarasin have a strong connection with the Force, and their spiritual leaders are often able to call upon the Force in small ways. The tarasin believe that the ch'hala tree is sacred. This may have been influenced by the trees having a similar ability to shift their colors as the tarasin, but it is also the most unique tree on Cularin. 

### Names
Tarasin names are generally very soft and melodic. Names are agendered, and surnames are not used.

**Names.** Feliosa, Misona, Nissira, Vylana, Ziransa

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:476px'></div>

### Tarasin Traits
As a tarasin, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Tarasins reach adulthood at 10 and live less than 80 years.

***Alignment.*** Tarasins' curious yet composed nature causes them to tend toward balanced alignments, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Tarasins typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 130 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Chameleon Skin.*** Your scales are translucent, allowing your color-shifting skin to help you blend into your surroundings. You have proficiency in the Stealth skill. Additionally, you can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.

***Jungle Dweller.*** Growing up in the jungles of Cularin has left an impact. You don't treat jungle terrain as difficult terrain.

***Naturalist.*** You have proficiency in the Nature skill.

***Sa'tosin Sense.*** Tarasins have short spines called sa'tosin that allow them to sense the use of the Force. You are constantly under the effects of the force power *sense force*, though the power does not require concentration for you.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Tarasinese. You can communicate non-verbally with other tarasins through use of a complex system of skin color changes.

### Biology and Appearance
Taung are a humanoid species of tall and strong sentient simians. Physically, the taung are extremely resilient and are able to endure hardships many other species are unable to, which benefits their warlike nature as well as their tendencies to conquer planets.

### Society and Culture
Taung society is one steeped in war, and the taung are warriors above all else. Nomadic and clan-based, the taung greatly value strength and honor, with pragmatism and ruthlessness being common traits amongst them. Originally waging war as a means of ritual worship to their god Kad Ha'rangir, the taung eventually became the Mandalorians, and - under the leadership of Mandalore the Indomitable - the act of war itself became the center of Mandalorian worship, and to wage war is to *be* divine.

Despite their volatile nature, the taung are far from primitive, and maintain a high priority in procuring the latest technological advancements whenever possible.

The Mandalorian armor that has become iconic throughout the galaxy originally began with the culture's taung founders, with their unique helmets and war masks being forged in the image of the taung's face, including slanted outer angles and a pointed chin. However, the armor is quite sparse among the taung as they believe that unarmed combat brings the highest honor.

### Names
Taung names reflect their practical nature, typically choosing names that correspond to traits they deem desirable. Their names are rarely gender specific and can apply to either male or female. Their surnames reflect that of the clan they hail from.

**First Names.** Adenn (merciless), Atin (stubborn), Kot (strength), Kotep (brave), Tor (justice), Verd (soldier)

**Surnames.** Cadera, Fett, Keldau, Lok, Ordo, Vizla

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Taung reach adulthood at 13 and live to around 85, though they rarely live even half the length as they naturally can due to their deadly lifestyles as Mandalorians.

***Alignment.*** The taung live by the traditions and honor-bound code of the Mandalorians, making them tend towards a lawful alignment, typically balanced or dark, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Taung typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh around 210 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Claws.*** Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage.

***Toughness.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level. 

***Relentless Endurance.*** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

***Taung Weapon Training.*** You gain proficiency in one vibroweapon and one blaster of your choice.

***Menacing.*** You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.

***Force Insensitive.*** While taung can be manipulated by the force, they cannot sense the Force. You can not use force powers or take levels in forcecasting classes.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Mando'a. Mando'a is primarily a spoken language and is very expressive with simple grammar.

<div style='margin-top:46px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The original appearance of the theelin is officially uncertain, as almost all known "theelin" are not full-blooded specimens, but hybrids. It is possible that some aspects of these individuals' appearances are not from their theelin genes, but from other near-human ancestors. Most, however, have vividly colored hair and pale skin, often mottled with colorful spots. Unfortunately, a series of mutations arose among later generations of theelin. These mutations have led to genetic incompatibilities within their species, making it impossible to produce offspring. Even attempts to continue their species by cross-breeding with other near-humans could not stop the theelin slide towards extinction, due to the high infant mortality rates such couplings suffer from. Theelin began inevitably dwindling in number—only a few million theelin and part-theelin remain by the time the Republic fell, and pure theelin are presumed extinct by the fall of the Empire. Some of their greatest works are produced in these years, however, as an epitaph for a dying people. 

### Society and Culture
Theelin performers and artists created many of the galaxy's greatest works of art. The Theelin Divas, an all-female religious order, are recognized by many scholars of music as the greatest singers in the galaxy. Because of the rarity of the theelin, many female theelin and part-theelin are named "Diva" at birth, in hopes that they will develop the musical talent necessary to continue the traditions of the Diva order.

### Names
Theelin use names similar to those in their community, typically human-similar names with exotic tinges.

**Male Names.** Dhess, Gooti, Jánsone, Qylett

**Female Names.** Fániss, Diva, Prystill, Saqua

**Surnames.** Joolie, Masozi, Oasay, Rellik

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:257px'></div>

### Theelin Traits
As a theelin, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.

***Age.*** Theelin reach adulthood in their late teens and live for about 70 years.

***Alignment.*** Theelin's good-nature and positivity despite the dour state of their species causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Theelin typically stand 5 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 140 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Expressive.*** You have proficiency in your choice of artist's implements, disguise kits, synthweaver's implements, or one musical instrument of your choice.

***Performer.*** You have proficiency in the Performance skill.

***Skill Versatility.*** You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and one extra language of your choice.

***Mutation.*** Theelin gain unique mutations, a result of cross-breeding with other humanoids. Choose one of the following mutations.
___
- **Balanced Hooves.** You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws against being knocked prone.
- **Darkvision.**  You can see in dim light within 30 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
- **Enhanced Senses.** Choose one from hearing, sight, or smell. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check related to the chosen sense, you are considered to have expertise in the Perception skill.
- **Heightened Reflexes.** Whenever you make a Dexterity ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can choose to add 1d4 to the result. You can choose to do this after the check is rolled, but before the DM determines if you’ve passed or failed the check. You cannot do so again until you complete a short or long rest.
- **Unarmed Combatant.** Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage and have the finesse property.

<div style='margin-top:25px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Thisspiasians are easily recognized by their abundant beards and their long tails, which often reach over six feet. These tails are very strong and are commonly used to carry large objects. When meditating or at rest, a thisspiasian will coil their tail beneath their torso, reducing their height by several feet. They also possess four arms, with the upper set being stronger and larger. Each of their four hands have five fingers, and each finger is tipped with a long, sturdy claw. It is thought unsophisticated or unseemly by upper-class thisspiasians to have the bottom two visible in public, so they are generally hidden from sight via larger garments, with the smaller limbs sometimes even bound to their bodies. Thisspiasians need very little sleep to function normally, resting for only two hours a day, with brief meditative moments scattered throughout the day to refocus.

### Society and Culture
Thisspiasian culture is one of proud warriors who keep their emotions well-concealed and their rages checked. Many outsiders see only a thisspiasian's outward facade of tranquility, and to most being it seems as if thisspiasians existed in a sea of calm. This is far from the truth, however, as they are in truth a very passionate species below the surface. A thisspiasian who doesn't meditate as often as they should will often be prone to otherwise atypical emotional outbursts.

Thisspias is ruled by a hereditary leader called the Blood Monarch. Due to their seemingly archaic ruling structure, thisspiasians are often considered out-of-touch. 

### Names
Thisspiasian names typically are composed of two similar sounding syllables. Surnames are familial. 

**First Names.** Annak, Effed, Emmet, Gorro, Koto

**Surnames.** Albarn, Braibel, Kirsingr, Raledurn

\columnbreak

### Thisspiasian Traits

### Biology and Appearance
Tiss'shar are bipedal therapods descended from predatory reptilians native to the humid jungle continents of Tiss'sharl. They are relatively strong and agile, with long necks, slender torsos, wider hips, and a short but wiry tail. Their mouths are filled with short, sharp teeth, and their large tongues are pink and constantly moving. Their large eyes appear glassy as a result of the clear, resilient film that covered and protected them. Many tiss'shar have prominent sickle-shaped claws on the first toe of their feet; some also possessed a crest of feathers atop their heads.

### Society and Culture
Tiss'shar social structure is inextricably tied to business. Nearly all tiss'shar families have a corporation as a patron, which provides the family with its material needs in exchange for the dedicated labor of its members. Patron corporations regularly supply food, housing, health care, education, and security services. The predatory instincts of the tiss'shar, redirected into the realm of business, often serve them well. While no stereotype fully defines the species, they often were considered aggressive, resourceful, calculating businessbeings. These traits also made them excellent assassins and gunfighters, renowned galaxywide for their efficiency. Most tiss'shar had an appreciation for the art of the deal, and conducted their business legitimately; even those who chose the path of the assassin remembered that they were conducting business and respected their contracts.

### Names
Tiss'shar names are segmented, with males receiving an additional "tail name." Surnames always come last.

**Male Names.** Si-Di-Ri, Tra-Skan-Lor, Geor-Dan-Thi 

**Female Names.** Von-Ra, Ura-Vaza, Shu-Xangiz, Sav-Lork

<div style='margin-top:35px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Tognath are a sentient species native to Yar Togna. Yar Togna is a foul-smelling, high-gravity planet with a toxic, fume-saturated atmosphere. As a result, tognath wear a breathing apparatus to process the oxygen content in a planet's atmosphere. The tognath have a striking look thanks to their insectoid and mammalian characteristics; another factor is their having both an endo- and exoskeleton. They also possess a very primitive nervous system, which provides them with immunity to most pain (a helpful trait in combat). Tognath begin life as larvae born from egg clutches hatched in a suspension jelly, and latch onto one of their parents, feeding directly from their bloodstream. While in that jelly, two or more eggs (not necessarily from the same parent) sometimes graft together, thus creating a bond that continues throughout the life of the eggmates. Six months later, parents visit a nursery tree, where the young detatch from them and spin a cocoon. Within, the offspring undergo a metamorphosis, developing both their skeletons to resist the high gravity and pressures of Yar Togna.

### Society and Culture
Tognath live in stilted homes with lava channels near the main mountain range of Yar Togna, where they have access to mountain springwater. Most of tognath society believes that mate selection and egg laying should occur late in life, after having dedicated most of one's prime years to a career. This means that parents are generally retired and dote on their children relentlessly, often homeschooling them after their transformation. 

### Names
Tognath use generally simple, nongendered names, without bothering with surnames.

**First Names.** Darjia, Essec, Irion, Tathak

<br><div style='margin-top:295px'></div>

### Tognath Traits
As a tognath, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores increase by 1.

***Age.*** Tognath reach adulthood by 10 and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Tognath are famously dedicated and hard workers, causing them to tend towards balanced alignments, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Tognath typically stand 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 140 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Crafters.*** You have proficiency with one set of artisan's implements of your choice.

***Exoskeleton.*** You have a thick exoskeleton. While you are unarmored or wearing light armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

***Foreign Biology.*** You cannot breathe oxygen. The tognath have created a breathing apparatus to negate the negative effects of living in an oxygen rich environment, but if your mask is removed while you are in such an environment, you lose consciousness.

***Life in the Void.*** You have resistance to necrotic damage, and while exposed to the vacuum of space, you can survive for a number of hours equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 hour), instead of a number of rounds.

***Primitive Nerves.*** Because of their primitive nervous systems, tognath are immune to most pain, letting them shrug off major injuries. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total. Once you've used this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Vocalizer.*** Tognath vocal cords are not made for oxygen rich environments, and rely on a vocalizer to communicate effectively with other species. If your vocalizer is removed or destroyed, your voice becomes quiet and difficult to understand.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Tognath. You can understand spoken and written Galactic Basic, but your vocal cords do not allow you to speak it.

### Biology and Appearance
The Togorian people are a feline warrior species native to the planet Togoria. They are large, heavy-framed bipeds, with retractable claws on their hands and feet. Female Togorians grow up to 7 feet tall, while adult males can reach up to 9 feet. They're covered in gray-white, black, brown, or orange fur, often with colorful spots or stripes. 

### Society and Culture
Togorians have a unique cultural division between<br> their sexes. They evolved as nomadic hunters of<br> creatures like the bist and etelo, surviving on the<br> wilderness as apex predators. As time went on, a rift in<br> their society developed between the two sexes. Males<br> were drawn to continue their lifestyle as nomads and<br> hunters for their people, while females tended to<br> prefer remaining in permanent camps and contributed<br> the vast majority of their species technological<br> developments. This division has continued into<br> modern times, with males continuing their nomadic<br> traditions and females frequently preferring to stay in<br> villages and cities. Males visit their mates for about a<br> month each year, but otherwise the sexes live<br> completely separate lives. Whether in spite of this<br> separation of the sexes, or because of it, Togorians are<br> typically monogamous and devoted to their chosen<br> mates.

### Names
Togorian names tend to be short and primal-sounding. Female names tend to include softer consonants and more vowels, while male names are typically harsher. Togorians do not use surnames.

**Male Names.**  Mezgraf, Mlatar, Morto, Mrrov, Torr

**Female Names.** Coelle, Elotis, H'sishi, Kra'ake, Rrowv

### Biology and Appearance
A mammalian species of winged, stout bodied humanoids, the Toydarians have stubby facial tusks which protruded from their lower jaw and framed a short pudgy trunk. While their stubby legs can support their body weight, Toydarians' primary mode of locomotion was their use of the wings on their upper back. Though their wings can beat as fast as ten times a second, the effort burned up large amounts of energy, causing the species to need to replenish itself often through regularly eating mass quantities of food. In order to fuel this hyperactive metabolism, Toydarians eat concentrated foods and egg-seeds. Most of the bloodiest wars in their history were fought over food supplies. 

### Society and Culture
Despite being ruled by the Hutts, the Toydarian people are able to govern themselves free of major outside intervention through the establishment of a feudal monarchy. A ruling king sits on the planet's throne, allowing vassals to form allegiances and have minor disputes to solve their own problems. The king makes sure to keep his vassals happy and to have their allegiance, but will occasionally encourage infighting to reveal the true character of the vassals and weed out treachery. 

Toydarians are known as shrewd businessmen.

### Names
Toydarian names are fairly simple and guttural, but a few harsher elements can be found here and there. Male names are generally shorter than female names. Female names always end in a vowel. 

**Male Names.** Dod, Nesteddo, Tul, Zloomroo

**Female Names.** Fefiffe, Lenlibo, Nugni, Zoldibu

**Surnames.** Daab, Faabb, Kepo, Mitra, Vulba

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Business Savvy.*** A common trait of all Toydarians is their shrewd business sense and their ability to haggle any deal. A loyal and proud people, these traits could be off-putting to outsiders, as many Toydarians in the galaxy were seen as crooks or slimy businessmen, but this was not always the case. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check involving haggling you are considered to have expertise in the Persuasion skill.

***Closed Mind.*** Toydarian brains have an unusual composition which made them resistant to influence from the Force. You have advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws against force powers.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic, Huttese, and Toydarian.

### Biology and Appearance
Ugnaughts are diminutive, porcine humanoids who have pink skin, upturned noses, white hair, and thick layers of jowls. Some have tusks that they use in blood duels. They are strong and resilient, and their life-spans reached up to 200 standard years. They notably eat genteslugs.

### Society and Culture
Ugnaughts are ruled by councils comprised of elected officers. Ugnaughts live their lives in accordance to their "blood profession", with Ugnaught parents teaching their children their trade. Infant Ugnaughts are known as Ugletts. If the number of new Ugnaughts in a given profession exceeds the need, a blood duel is called. When the Ugnaughts reached their twentieth year of age, these fights are held to the death, with the victor winning the right to inherit their blood profession. Despite this outdated and violent custom, the Ugnaughts are generally a peaceful people with a rich culture.

When greeting an Ugnaught, it is advised to bow silently, then wait for a guttural purring as a positive response. Usage of the common galactic greeting "yaa-yaah" is considered a personal insult to Ugnaughts. If this occurrs, it was advisable to duck and cover, as various mechanical implements will be thrown one's way. 

Ugnaughts are often enslaved as they are fairly<br> meek.

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Ugors are sentient, unicellular protozoans. Considered exotic for being one of the few sentient species to fall outside the standard classificiations of birds, mammals, etc. Their bodies consist of cytoplasm, which can vary in colors and shade, bound by a slime-coated membrane. Being amorphic, ugors can assume nearly any shape, and can exude pseudopodia limbs such as crude arms, mouths, and sensory organs, although a globular form was the most comfortable and easy to maintain. Due to their unique physiology and evolution, they are able to digest substances that would prove toxic to other species, and can subsist on other species' trash. While most maintain globular form, some who interact with humanoid species will wear EVA suits or armor to give themselves a humanoid appearence. 

### Society and Culture
Ugor society revolves around trading and scavenging; they are famed for providing equipment to nascent civilizations and for salvaging wreckage from failed ones. The beings are supremely adaptable and astutely able to get what they want from others. Ugor business deals are extremely complex, incorporating opaque knots of loans, interest, and payment plans. Ugors have an intense love of trash, which they base their religions off, and excel at those skills that are useful in their pursuit of rubbish collection: a member of the species' education emphasizes skills related to scavenging and starship operation (although members of the species rarely became more than passable pilots).

### Names
Ugor names typically consisted of two parts, with no notable difference between the genders. Ugor do not use surnames.

### Biology and Appearance
Umbarans, called the "Shadow People" by some, are a<br> near-human species characterized by their pale, bluish<br> skin and colorless, sunken eyes. Their homeworld,<br> Umbara, is situated deep within the Ghost Nebula, and<br> receives almost no direct light from the planet's<br> primary star. As a result, Umbaran eyes are well-<br>adjusted to seeing in low light, and can see into the<br> ultraviolet spectrum, but can be disoriented by bright<br> light.

### Society and Culture
Umbaran society is strictly divided into a leveled caste system, with most Umbarans constantly scheming to improve their social rank, using tactics such as blackmail, subterfuege, and even assassination if necessary. Only those within the ten highest caste tiers were given opportunities to leave their homeworld. Because of the cutthroat machinations required to get there, Umbarans in the wider galaxy are known as skilled, ruthless politicians. This reputation is enhanced by the Umbarans' talents for reading and influencing the emotions of others.

Umbara developed its own technological advances separate from galactic society, and possessed technology that was in many fields far more advanced than the galactic standard. 

### Names
Umbaran names are typically no more than one or two syllables. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Mee, Pir, Nyss, Moshenu  

**Female Names.** Sly, Syll, Myn, Sata 
 
**Surnames.** Deechi, Moore, Phobi, Nenn

<div style='margin-top:82px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Verpine are thin bipedal insectoids whose heads are dominated by large compound eyes. They also have two antennae, one located behind each eye. Their hardened carapace, composed of a green chitinous substance called carahide, is as flexible as the skin of other creatures, yet tough enough to deflect a blade or even absorb a glancing blaster bolt. The Verpine circulatory system does not contain a heart.

Verpine eyes are keen enough to pick out microscopic details. Their antennae contain tympanic nerves which pick up sound. Their antennae are also sensitive to radio waves, giving Verpine the natural ability to sense and transmit radio waves to communicate with another Verpine in their language over long distances.

### Society and Culture
The Verpine people hail from the Roche asteroid field, which is the fractured remnants of their home planet. The Roche live in artificial, self-sustaining environments inside these fragments.

Verpine culture is oriented around crafting; they are noteworthy manufacturers of weapons, shield generators, armor, as well as personal use items such as breathing apparatuses. They are also gifted pilots.

### Names
Verpine had variable naming customs. Not all Verpines adopt surnames. Male and female Verpine names do not differentiate.

**First Names.** Fxz'et, Kuli, Moegid, Ss's, Zix

Most Voss live peacefully in Voss-Ka, caring for their families, cultivating the wild plants and maintaining equipment for the Voss commandos in the war against the Gormak, although some Voss do live outside the capital city, such as the Voss Mystics who reside in the Shrine of Healing. The Voss are great lovers of art, and their architecture features a distinctive artistic style. The entire Voss society is guided by the Force visions of Voss Mystics, which are considered infallible without exception.

### Biology and Appearance
Vurks are the predominant sentient species of the planet Sembla. They are tall, reptilian humanoids with bulbous dark eyes and sweeping head crests. Their hands and feet have three digits each, one of which was opposable. They have distinguishing gray-green, leathery skin. Being able to breathe both water and air, they are perfectly adapted to travel Sembla's warm, shallow seas dotted with volcanic islands. They share a strong nomadic instinct with their amphibious ancestors.  

### Society and Culture
Young Vurk males are married off by their parents; those who failed to marry before reaching adulthood remain bachelors for the rest of their lives. Because their way of living resulted in virtually no sizable permanent settlement whatsoever, Vurks were generally considered primitive by the rest of the galaxy; however, that was not true. They are very intelligent and believe in a highly developed philosophical tradition that emphasizes personal integrity and individual freedom and encourage personal honesty. Their compassionate and calm manner made them better than average diplomats.

Vurks are very family-oriented. It is common for multiple generations to remain in the same location as a single household, with the eldest family member being the patriarch or matriarch and making the decision for the entire family.

### Names
Vurk names are traditionally two to three syllables. Female names typically end with a vowel, while male names vary. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Coleman, Jadran, Milanko, Zlatko

<div style='margin-top:62px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Xexto are spindly invertebrates with four arms with six fingers and two legs with ten toes. Almond-shaped eyes dominate a small head perched atop a long neck. Their brain is split between two parts of their body; the part located in the skull controls primitive emotions and basic body functions, while another portion in their chest controls higher functions such as creative thinking and logic. It's believed that xexto's body structure and lightning-fast reflexes developed to help them escape predators while pursuing their own prey, there is no question that genetic manipulation forever altered their evolutionary development.

### Society and Culture
Although the Old Republic had long since outlawed experimentation on sentient beings, unscrupulous arkanian geneticists continued to search for primitive sentients on distant planets as fodder for their experiments. One such group found the xexto's forbears- a society of loosely organized hunter-gatherer tribes taking shelter in the trees of Troiken. Independently, they developed technologically advanced civilizations, and were on the verge of attaining interstellar travel when Republic scouts contacted them. Difficult terrain and dangerous predators found on their homeworld have led many Xexto to admire and encourage risk-taking. Despite their thrillseeking nature and willingness to take risks, xexto are generally well mannered and even-tempered. Questioning a Xexto's bravery is one way to make him or her angry. 

### Names
Xexto have very unique names, often sounding odd to outsiders. Surnames are familiar but optional.

Physically, the Yevetha are tall beings with a ghoulish appearance that is bereft of any body hair, being described as being so gaunt as to seem skeletal due to their pallid gray skin and lithe builds. The species possesses six fingered hands that have retractable dewclaws. Each one is located on the inside of the wrist above their six-fingered hands. Their dewclaws shoot from a sheath of a skin beneath their cadaverous hands and are capable of being retracted. When extended fully, the wrist blades reach about a foot in length, and are used in close combat and blood sacrifices. The Yevetha also possess a greater tolerance for g-forces when compared to Human pilots.

### Society and Culture
Within their society, blood is an important aspect of their culture and is a central focus of their religious belief system. This has resulted in them becoming a particularly violent species. For the Yevetha, death is not to be feared. They are described as being dutiful, attentive, cautious but also fatalistic in their view of the universe. When fighting against other foes, Yevetha are notable for being ruthless fighters who never surrender even in the face of certain defeat. Due to the brutal nature of their society, the Yevetha do not possess a single jail, penitentiary or stockade as they believe there is no need for such facilities. In fact, they do not possess a word in their language for either convict or incarcerate.

### Names
Yevetha names are sharp and are kept to one syllable, not varying significantly based on gender. Surnames are familial.

<div style='margin-top:50px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Zeltrons are one of the few near-human species that differentiated from the baseline stock enough to be considered a new species of the Human genus, rather than simply a subspecies. They possess two biological traits of note. The first is that they all produce potent pheromones, similar to the Falleen species, which enhanced their attractiveness and likeability. The second is a limited telepathic ability, used to project emotions onto others, as well as allowing them to read and even feel the emotions of others; some Zeltrons have been hired by the Exchange for this ability. Because of their telepathic ability, positive emotions such as happiness, love and pleasure are very important to them, while negative ones such as anger, fear, or depression are shunned.

### Society and Culture
Zeltron culture is highly influenced by sexuality and the pursuit of pleasure in general. Most of their art and literature is devoted to the subject, producing some of the raciest pieces in the galaxy. Zeltrons are known to dress in wildly colorful or revealing attire. It's common to see Zeltrons wearing shockingly bright shades of neon colors in wildly designed bikinis, or nearly skin tight clothing of other sorts with bizarre color designs, patterns, and symbols. 

### Names
Zeltron names often have an air of mystique to them, to evoke sensuality. For a Zeltron, a beautiful face is nothing without an equally beautiful name. It's not uncommon for a Zeltron to forsake their familial surname in favor of a more attractive-sounding one.

**Male Names.** Marruc, Bahb, Rahulh, Demagol 

**Female Names.** Lyshaa, Dani, Vianna, Chantique 

**Surnames.** D'Pow, Blue, Duare, Sapphire

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:426px'></div>

### Zeltron Traits
As a zeltron, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score<br> increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases<br> by 1.

***Age.*** Zeltron reach adulthood in their late teens and live about 80 years.

***Alignment.*** Zeltron are a deeply sensual, hedonistic species, causing them to tend toward chaotic balanced or dark side alignments, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Zeltron tend to be slender and statuesque, typically standing between 5 and 6 feet tall and rarely weighing more than 150 lb. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Charismatic.*** You have proficiency with Deception or Persuasion (your choice). 

***Enthralling Pheromones.*** You can use your pheromones to influence individuals of both sexes. Whenever you roll a 1 on a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. Additionally, once per short or long rest, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower on a Charisma check as a 10. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.

***Natural Empathy.*** Zeltron's limited telepathy allow them to sense mood shifts in those around them. You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine emotions against humanoids and beasts within 10 feet of you.

***Two Livered.*** Zeltron have two livers, which makes them adept at filtering toxins. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage (explained in chapter 9).

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and one language of your choice.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The zilkins are a bipedal, amphibious species discernible by their diminutive stature and stalk eyes. Their homeworld, Zilk, has many dense jungles and swamps deemed impossible to navigate by most species. Only the zilkins themselves, evolved from worm-like creatures, were able to easily slip through the gaps in the tangled, coarse foliage. Their powerful legs make them adept at swimming and leaping.

Zilkin also have bulbous chins which inflate with excess air while they are speaking.

### Society and Culture
Their short lifespans cause zilkins to be one of the fastest learners in the galaxy, capable of learning in weeks what takes other species months. Zilkins live in large communities woven into the thick clumps of trees on Zilk. Whenever a dispute occurs, zilkins turn to a ritualistic form of debate where everyone affected voices their opinion on the matter. Whoever croaks their views the loudest and most confidently, wins. As a result, zilkins tend to be quite opinionated.

For a long time, the zilkins remained unknown to the galaxy at large, simply because few individuals had any interest in visiting Zilk, let alone exploring its notoriously impenetrable jungles. Having lived in isolation for so many generations, and often mocked for their size, zilkins tend to exhibit cantankerous behavior toward other species. Despite this, a number of zilkins leave their homeworld and take an active role in galactic politics, gaining the planet representation in the Senate.

### Names
Zilkin names are usually clear and concise. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Belip, Jegg, Meebur, Ponix

**Female Names.** Fula, Nili, Sia, Vo

**Surnames.** Bestrein, Cruu, Odebre, Telvet

### Biology and Appearance
The Zygerrians are a bipedal, sentient humanoid species. Feline in appearance, the species possesses strong, angular features, with long fangs jutting from their jaws and claws extending from their hands. The Zygerrians' faces and their pointed ears are almost entirely covered with fur; males usually have more hair than females, with bands of fur growing on their cheeks. Male Zygerrians also display a number of bony spurs protruding from the chin, which females typically lack. Zygerrians usually have sallow complexions and are physically strong, but some suffer from obesity. 

### Society and Culture
A warlike species, the Zygerrians hold strength—both physical and mental—in great esteem, viewing it as a means to gain power and authority. They believe that it is the natural order of life for the strong to dominate the weak, so slavery is normal for the species, and a display of weakness could mean death or enslavement in their culture. Those who become their slaves are viewed as inferior by the Zygerrians.

Zygerrian society is organized into clans and classes. They have a noble class, many members of which, despite their high status, pursue a career in the military. The Zygerrian government is a monarchy; female rulers hold the title of Queen, and males are addressed as Kings.

The center of the Zygerrian society is the Zygerrian Slavers Guild, which focuses on the slave trade in the Outer Rim Territories. 

### Names
Zygerrian names are rather diverse, though shorter names are the most common. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Agruss, Darts, Atai, Sono

**Female Names.** Miraj, Faralhi, Latrans, MaDall

**Surnames.** D'nar, Molec, Scientel, Thanda, Tyne
