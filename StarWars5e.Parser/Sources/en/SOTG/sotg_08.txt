<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/XSXXqiB.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:71px;width:39px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iving through an asteroid field, docking in a<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; space port, or simply exploring the wild blue yonder, are the things that *Star Wars* adventures are made of. Your character, with the aid of their ship, might explore wild space, undertake dangerous smuggling missions, or dispatch pirate ships. And if all goes well, your character will survive to claim rich rewards before embarking on a new adventure.

This chapter covers the basics of adventuring in space, from the mechanics of movement to the acquisition of the ship itself. The rules for repair are also in this chapter, along with a discussion of the activities your characters might pursue between adventures.

Whether adventurers are exploring uncharted territories or a complicated relationship with a criminal organization, the game follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book's introduction:

___

&emsp;**1. The GM describes the environment.**

**2. The players describe what they want to do.**

**3. The GM narrates the results of their actions.**

___

Typically, the GM uses a map as an outline of the adventure, tracking the characters' progress as they explore enclave corridors or wilderness regions.

The GM's notes, including a key to the map, describe what the adventurers find as they enter each new area. Sometimes, the passage of time and the adventurers' actions determine what happens, so the GM might use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a map.

## Ship Registration
Pilots are required to register their starships with the Bureau of Ships and Services (or BoSS). Additionally, at registration, the pilot must acquire an Operating License at the cost of 1,000 credits. To be eligible for this license they must pass a written piloting test, which requires a DC 15 Intelligence (Piloting) check.

### Transponder Codes
When ships are created, they are assigned a unique signal called a transponder code. Once registered with the BoSS, this signal can be used to identify that ship using the BoSS database. The transponder code can be used to identify a ship's owner, designation, make and model, as well as any registered modifications. Additionally, a transponder code can be used to access the ship's ownership history.

The transponder code is built into the ship's sublight engines, making any attempt to remove or alter it incredibly difficult; failing an attempt could damage or destroy a ship's engines.

<br>

> ##### The Bureau of Ships and Services
> The Bureau of Ships and Services (BoSS) is a long-standing, impartial, third-party galactic organization that manages all data related to the massive number of starships present in the galaxy. The BoSS has stood for thousands of years due to their ability to stay neutral in conflicts.
>
> Information on a ship's ownership and its captains certifications are kept on file at the BoSS at all times. The data is distributed to spaceports upon request, but it is an expensive and slow process. As a result of this, smaller spaceports rarely update their registries more than once a year.
>
> The security on BoSS computer systems is of the highest caliber money can buy, making it almost impossible to access without proper authorization codes.

## Communications
Starships are equipped with basic systems that allow for communication in realspace. Typically, starship communications systems are limited to contact ships and planets within the same system, although boosters and specialized radios can reach up to several light-years. Opening a channel to a willing recipient is simply a matter of pinging their ship. They will receive a notification and can respond, opening the lines of communication.

### HoloNet
The Holonet is an instantaneous communication system that allows planets to stay in contact despite the vast distances between them. A HoloNet transceiver transmits and receives information through hyperspace, allowing information to travel millions of times faster than the speed of light. Hyperwave transceivers are embedded at strategic locations, constantly relaying information throughout the galaxy. This networks allows for instantaneous three-dimensional holographic communications at virtually any distance, making it one of the primary means of communication. Government agencies, such as the military, typically maintain their own encrypted circuits on the HoloNet. Some experienced slicers have been able to access these encrypted channels, though it required access to a government compound for the requisite codes.

\pagebreakNum

### METOSP (Message to Spacers)
Upon arrival in a star system, most starships immediately connect to a specialized frequency responsible for communicating with incoming and outbound ships, called Message to Spacers, or METOSP. The METOSP message typically conveys a repeated greeting with information about flight hazards (such as blockades, weather, debris, or collisions) and relevant local regulations or customs (such as embargoes, tariffs, or landing procedures). All METOSPs are broadcast in Galactic Basic, though some worlds also broadcast in their native language. A METOSP provides pilots with contact information for spaceport control as well as information on landing patterns and traffic lanes. Most METOSPs are brief, repeating messages that refer listeners to other channels for specific information.

### Planetary Information Channels
Most planets also provide incoming space traffic with basic computer communication channels. These channels connect the ship to planetary information networks that provide everything from communications directory assistance to tourism information and planetary maps. Planetary information channels allow use of the Technology skill to access information relevant to the planet, and it possible for a slicer to access other functions.

## Time
In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In an enclosed environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a scale of minutes. It takes them about a minute to navigate an asteroid field, a minute to dock in a space port, and a good 10 minutes to clear customs.

While traveling in realspace, a scale of hours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach a pirate stronghold on the other side of the planet travel those 150 miles in just over an hour.

In hyerspace, however, a scale of days works best. Following the hyperlane from Tatooine to Kashyyyk, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a pirate ambush interrupts their journey.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time described in chapter 9.

## Movement and Travel
There are two significant travel types: Realspace and Hyperspace. 


### Travel in Realspace
All starships have sublight engines that propel them through realspace, using them when taking off, landing, or flying within a gravity sphere. 

When traveling in realspace, the GM can summarize the adventurers' movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: "You fly around the planet, reaching the stronghold late in the evening." 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:25px'></div>


&emsp;Sometimes it's important, though, to know how far, how fast, and how maneuverable your ship is in a short window of time. Starships come equipped with two speeds: **flying speed** and **turning speed**. 

#### Flying Speed
**Flying speed** is how far your ship can travel in a single round. It is expressed in feet. For every foot your ship travels forward, it expends one foot from its speed.

A ship's unmodified flying speed is determined in **Chapter 3: Starships** by the Role selected for the ship at construction.

#### Turning Speed
**Turning speed** determines how maneuverable your ship is. In order for your ship to rotate 90 degrees, you must spend an amount of your **flying speed** equal to your **turning speed**. For instance, if your ship has a **flying speed** of 350 feet, and a **turning speed** of 100 feet, you can travel 150 feet in a straight line, spending 150 feet of your **flying speed**, and then turn 90 degrees to starboard, spending 100 feet of your **flying speed**, leaving 100 feet of movement remaining.

Typically games are played with turning limited to 90 degree increments, but, if your group has the desire and capability to track smaller angles, this is allowed.

A ship can turn more (or less, if your group agrees) than 90 degrees on its turn, by spending a proportionate amount of movement.

If a ship's turning speed exceeds its flying speed, that ship cannot turn 90 degrees, in combat conditions, absent another effect modifiying the ship's turning speed and/or flying speed or the Hard Turn action.

A ship's unmodified turning speed is determined in **Chapter 3: Starships** by the Role selected for the ship at construction.


#### Travel Pace
While traveling in realspace, a starship can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace. While traveling at a fast pace, your starship's flying speed is doubled, but your starship&mdash;and its crew&mdash;have disadvantage on Intelligence (Probe) and Wisdom (Scan) checks. While traveling at a slow pace, your flying speed is halved, but you can travel stealthily. A fast pace makes a ship less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully (see the "Activity While Traveling" section later in this chapter for more information).

You can use the following **Sample Realspace Travel Times** table to determine travel times in realspace for an average starship traveling at a normal pace.

#### Sample Realspace Travel Times
|Distance|Time Required|
|:--|--:|
|Surface of planet to orbit|1-5 minutes|
|Orbit to safe hyperspace jump distance|1 minute|
|Orbit to planet's moon|10-30 minutes|
|Orbit to another planet in the same system|2-6 hours|
|Orbit to outer edge of system|12-24 hours|

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 8 | ADVENTURING</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Difficult Terrain
The travel speeds given in the **Sample Realspace Travel Times** table assume unobstructed terrain. But adventurers often face narrow canyons, tight formations, or other difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain&mdash;moving 10 feet in difficult terrain costs 20 feet of flying speed&mdash;so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.

#### Fuel Usage

A ship uses a unit's worth of fuel for one day of flight in realspace or hyperspace, after one hour of flight in atmosphere, or in a single jump to hyperspeed.
 
#### Activity While Traveling
As adventurers travel on their starship, they need to remain alert for danger, and some characters might perform other tasks to help the group's journey.

> A ship might encounter a hostile ship while some crewmembers are resting or relaxing instead of deployed. It is up to the GM to determine how long it takes each crewmember to deploy.

#### Stealth
While traveling at a slow pace, the starship can move stealthily. As long as they're not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other starships they encounter. See the rules for hiding in chapter 7.

#### Noticing Threats
Use the passive Wisdom (Scan) score of the ship to determine whether anyone in the starship notices a hidden threat. The GM might decide that a threat can be noticed only by active characters. For example, as the characters are traveling through an asteroid field, the GM might decide that only those characters actively operating the ship (as opposed to remaining in their bunks) have a chance to spot a stealthy starship following the group. While traveling at a fast pace, the ship takes a -5 penalty to its passive Wisdom (Scan) score to notice hidden threats.

***Encountering Starships.*** If the GM determines that the adventurers encounter another starship while they're traveling, it's up to both groups to decide what happens next. Either group might decide to attack, initiate a dialogue, run away, or wait to see what the other group does.

***Surprising Foes.*** If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or group, the GM determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be surprised when combat erupts. See **Chapter 9: Combat** for more about surprise.

\columnbreak

#### Other Activities
Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused on watching for danger. However, a character not watching for danger can do one of the following activities instead, or some other activity with the GM's permission.

***Navigate.*** The character can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making an Intelligence (Astrogation) check when the GM calls for it. (The *Dungeon Master's Guide* has rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)

***Maintain a Map.*** The character can maintain a map that records the group's progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability check is required.

***Track.*** A character can follow the tracks of another starship, making an Intelligence (Probe) check when the GM calls for it. (The *Dungeon Master's Guide* has rules for tracking.)

> ##### Splitting Up the Party
> Splitting up the party is more difficult when your party only has one ship. Should they acquire a fleet of their own, however, they can form multiple parties, each moving at a different speed. Each group has its own deployment order.
>
> The drawback to this approach is that the party will be split into several smaller groups in the event of an attack. The advantage is that a small group of stealthy ships moving slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier ships would alert. A X-wing moving at a slow pace is much harder to detect than the Corellian Corvette they leave behind.

### Landing Gear
All ships, regardless of size, come with integrated landing gear, complete with magnetic clamps. A ship can use its landing gear to bind itself another ship of a larger size. The landing gear can be engaged remotely from the cockpit, or manually in the event of primary system failure.

### Movement in Zero Gravity
In some circumstances, such as prolonged power failure, or movement in space outside of the ship, a character might find themselves moving in zero gravity.

While in zero gravity, a character has a flying speed equal to their walking speed, and zero gravity is treated as difficult terrain.

If a character already had a flying speed, they instead do not treat zero gravity as difficult terrain.

### Travel in Hyperspace
The fastest way to travel long distances in space is through hyperspace. When a starship engages its hyperdrive, it accelerates beyond the speed of light and enters hyperspace. A starship in hyperspace can't communicate with ships in realspace. It is effectively cut off from realspace while in hyperspace.

Large objects that generate significant gravity, such as planets and stars, produce what is known as a "mass shadow" that projects into hyerspace. Collision with a mass shadow can have catastrophic repercussions. Hyperdrives have built-in safeguards that prevent a ship from jumping to hyperspace while inside of a mass shadow, causing a ship to immediately revert to realspace if the mass shadow is detected. Interdiction vesssels use gravity well generators to keep ships from activating their hyperdrives. Some pirates have been known to drag asteroids into hyperspace lanes in order to drag prey out of hyperspace.

A ship uses a unit's worth of fuel for one day of flight in hyperspace and one unit for a single jump to hyperspeed.

#### Travel Pace
While traveling in hyperspace, a starship travels at a set speed as determined by the classification of the hyperdrive. A class 1 hyperdrive travels at hyperspeed, while a class 2 hyperdrive travels at half hyperspeed, and a class .5 hyperdrive travels at twice hyperspeed. 

The galaxy at large is divided into territories, which are in turn subdivided into sectors. Traveling from one planet to another in the same sector takes less time than traveling from one planet to another in a different sector of the same territory. Consequently, traveling to a planet in a different territory takes even longer.

You can use the above **Base Hyperspace Travel Times** table to determine travel times. These times assume a class 1 hyperdrive.

\columnbreak

#### Astrogation
Plotting a hyperspace course requires incredibly difficult calculations. Before jumping to hyperspace, a ship must plot a course via astrogation by completing 10 astrogation equations. When not under stress, a crewmember can take 10 minutes to carefully make these calculations and check them, resulting in automatic success. When under duress, such as in combat situations, a crewmember can calculate astronavigation with an Intelligence (Astrogation) check as an action on their turn, and then consults the **Astrogation Results** table.

#### Astrogation Results
|d20|	Result|
|:--:|:--|
|9 or lower | Your calculations fail, resulting in no completed equations.|
|10-15 | Your calculations are adequate, resulting in one completed equation.|
|16-20 | Your calculations include a breakthrough, resulting in two completed equations.|
|21-25 | Your calculations are excellent, resulting in three completed equations.|
|26-29 | Your calculations are masterful, resulting in four completed equations.|
|30+   |Your calculations are perfect, resulting in five completed equations.|

Additionally, the accuracy of the check is affected by how old the astrogation information is. If the astrogation information is less than a day old, the operator has advantage on the check. If the information is older than a week, however, they have disadvantage on the check.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 8 | ADVENTURING</div>

\pagebreakNum

<img src='https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2c/e6/9d/2ce69d7343e3101d628122c45957c4dc.jpg' style='position:absolute;top:60px;right:00px;width:840px;z-index:1000; transform:scalex(1);filter:drop-shadow(0 0 10px rgba(13, 153, 204, 0.7))' />

<div style='margin-top:404px'></div>

You may choose to penalize your Intelligence (Astrogation) checks by 5 before making them in order to reduce your travel time by 24 hours; if this would reduce the travel time to less than 24 hours, you instead reduce the remaining travel time by one-half, to a minimum of 1 hour.  You must restart your calculations if you change this course choice.

Alternatively, you may gain a +5 circumstance bonus on your Intelligence (Astrogation) checks if you voluntarily double the travel time.

#### Hyperspace Hazards
A jump to hyperspace can always be rushed, being made before all ten equations are completed, but such travel can be incredibly dangerous. If a starship is disabled because of a poorly plotted hyperspace course, the GM usually chooses the point at which the ship drops out of hyperspace at random. GMs looking for a more in-depth description of a hyperspace mishap can consult the table below.  For every complete equation, add 1 to your roll on the table below. If you roll a 1 on your die, you roll again on the table in addition to suffering the indicated penalty.  If you make a jump without *any* calculations and roll a 20, your ship comes out of hyperspace unscathed, but in a completely unknown location.


#### Detecting Hyperspace Travel
When a starship enters or exits hyperspace, it generates a short burst of Cronau radiation. Any facility with adequate sensor arrays can detect this radiation burst with a DC 20 Wisdom (Scan) check. Success would indicate that a ship entered or exited the system as well as the point of arrival or departure. With a successful Intelligence (Probe) check (DC 25), the angle of departure can be determined, indicating possible destinations.

|:--:|:--|
|20+    |   The ship suffers no adverse consequences.|
|18-19    | The ship encounters dumped cargo, setting off a collision alarm. The ship must make a DC 15 Constitution save.  On a failure, the ship takes 3 hull dice of damage;  the ship takes half damage on a suc-<br>cess. The cargo is salvageable, it consists of 10d10 tons of cargo, each with a value of 10d10x10 credits.|
|15-17  | The ship passes through an uncharted dust cloud, clogging sensors and communications equipment. Scan and Probe checks aboard the ship are made with disadvantage until the ship is refitted. |
|12-14  | The ship passes too close to a supernova, overloading computer systems with solar radiation. Intelligence checks aboard the ship have disadvantage until the ship is refitted.|
|9-11  | The ship passes through an unexpected gravity field, causing structural stress. Maneuver checks are made with disadvantage until the ship is refitted.|
|6-8  | Intense gravity warps the vessel's structural integrity.  The ship's AC is reduced by 2 until the ship is refitted.|
|3-5  | The ship collides with significant debris, its hull immediately taking kinetic damage equal to one-tenth of its max HP, and shields regenerate at half their normal rate until the ship is refitted.|
|1-2    | The hyperdrive suffers a catastrophic failure, and is rendered unusable until the ship is refitted.|


>**The BoSS:** In addition to their duties of regulating information regarding ship ownership, the BoSS also maintains a database of astrogation information. Each time a ship docks in a major spaceport, they can update their astrogation data for a 150 credit fee. Astrogation data is routinely updated and is rarely more than a week old.

## Crewing a Ship
Ships have a minimum and maximum crew capacity determined by their size, modifications, and ability scores. Most Small fighters, for instance, have a single crewmember controlling all aspects of the ship. Medium ships, however, might have a crew of half a dozen, while larger ships have crews in the tens to hundreds of thousands. 

### Minimum Effective Crew
Ships other than Tiny have a minimum number of required crewmembers to operate effectively. A small ship has a minimum effective crew of 1. For medium and larger ships, the minimum effective crew is determined by a ship's Intelligence modifier and its size, as shown below in the **Starship Minimum Effective Crew by Size** table.  

#### Starship Minimum Effective Crew by Size 
######  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;***Ship Size*** 
|***Ship Intelligence<br> Modifier***|**Medium**|**Large**|**Huge**|**Gargantuan**|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|**-2**| 6| 800| 10,000|120,000|
|**-1**| 5| 600| 8,000|100,000|
|**0** | 4| 400| 7,000|80,000|
|**1** | 3| 200| 6,000|70,000|
|**2** | 2| 120| 5,000| 60,000|
|**3** | 1| 64| 4,000| 50,000| 
|**4** | 1| 32| 3,000| 40,000|
|**5** | 1| 16| 2,000| 30,000|
|**6** | 1| 8| 1,000| 20,000|
|**7** | -| - |   -  | 10,000|

This Minimum Effective Crew can be further altered by certain other features such as modifications.

> #### Shifts
>
> GMs should note that most large or larger starships have significantly larger crews than the minimum effective crew.  This is because such ships must be run and maintained constantly.  
>
>Such ships usually employ crew in three or more shifts, so that approximately one-third of the crew is on duty at any given time, allowing the ship to always maintain a minimum effective crew at all times. 

### Skeleton Crew

Ships can, in extremis, be run by a crew that is smaller than the minimum effective crew.  However, this can be dangerous and results in a ship that is less effective than it otherwise would be. 

#### Ongoing Effects
When a ship is run with a crew three-quarters the size of the minimum effective crew, the ship operates as though it were suffering from one more level of system damage than it otherwise would.  

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>


&emsp;When a ship is run with a crew one-half the size of the minimum effective crew, the ship operates as though it were suffering from two more levels of system damage than it otherwise would. 


When a ship is run with a crew one-quarter the size of the minimum effective crew, the ship operates as though it were suffering from three more levels of system damage than it otherwise would. 

When a ship is run with a crew one-tenth the size of the minimum effective crew, the ship operates as though it were suffering from four more levels of system damage than it otherwise would. 

A ship cannot operate with a skeleton crew if the skeleton crew would cause the ship to operate as though it had 5 or more levels of system damage.

#### Potential Damage
At the end of every full day of operation with a skeleton crew, the crewmember at the helm must make an Intelligence (Piloting) check to determine if the ship has suffered any damage as a result of operating with less than a minimum effective crew.  The DC for the check is 10 + 2 for every level of system damage the ship is operating at when the check is made.

### Maximum Crew Size

Tiny Ships have a maximum crew size of 0.  Small Ships normally have a maximum crew size of 1, but this limit can be raised with the addition one or more Crew Expansion suite modifications and the Astromech Socket modification.  Medium and larger ships have a maximum crew size determined only by logic and space constraints, but are still limited in the number of actions that the ship can take each turn (5+the maximum number of Fire actions that can be taken by that ship.)

### NPC Crews (Enlisted)

Some players may find themselves lacking the requisite number of crewmembers to properly manage a starship. Under such circumstances, they will find themselves in need of NPC crewmembers.

#### Acquiring an NPC Crew

##### Joining a Faction

Joining a large faction, such as the Galactic Republic or the Empire might merit being given charge of a crew. Generally, the crew is still loyal to the faction, but will continue to follow the orders of the party as long as they are not at odds with the faction’s goals. Refusing missions or violating the faction’s rule may lead to a labor strike, crew abandonment, or even mutiny.


##### Salaried Crew

The party could seek to hire a reputable crew by offering to pay them wages for their time, risk, and expertise. Generally, a salaried crewmember will require a salary of 10 credits per day and hiring bonus of 300 credits. Such a crew is generally averse to committing crimes. Committing crimes or failing to pay wages may lead to a labor strike, crew abandonment, or even mutiny.



<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 8 | ADVENTURING</div>

\pagebreakNum


##### Dispensational Crew

The party could seek to hire a less reputable crew by offering a portion of the ship’s profits. A dispensational crew generally requires 60% of profits split amongst the crew. Such a crew has no aversions to any actions or choices made by the crew. Failing to divide profits, however, may lead to a labor strike, crew abandonment, and a higher chance of mutiny. 

##### Droid Crew

The party could seek to build or purchase droids to crew their ship. Droid crews are different than humanoid crews in several different ways.
- Droids do not require pay, but do cost 900 credits per unit to purchase (half if built by the party) and cost 2 credits per day in maintenance. 
- Droid NPC crewmembers are considered medium-sized when determining housing arrangements. 
- Droids do not eat, but the ship has higher energy needs to keep droids powered up. For every suite capacity worth of droid NPC crewmembers (rounded down), the ship’s fuel usage increases by 10%. 
- While droids will not cause a labor strike, abandon the ship, or mutiny, failing to provide adequate power leads to one level of exhaustion for every droid NPC crewmember every day they are without power.
 

### Room and Board

Crewmembers generally expect room and board to be provided by the players. Each crewmember requires a place to sleep and one portion of food per day. Providing better housing reduces the amount the players need to pay their crew since this is considered a benefit of working for the players. 

- Barracks are considered the normal sleeping situation for most crews. 
- Providing living quarters to sleep in reduces the necessary pay for the crewmembers sleeping there by one third (2/3 the original pay). 
- Providing luxury quarters to sleep in reduces the necessary pay for the crewmembers sleeping there by one half (1/2 the original pay). 
- If sleeping quarters or food portions are not supplied (e.g., the ship is not in 24 hour service), the necessary pay for crewmembers increases by one half for each of these necessities not provided (1.5 or 2 times the original pay).


### NPC Crew Actions (Officers)

NPC crewmembers may be used for more than just reaching minimum crew requirements, they may also be used to take actions on a starship.  The cost of such NPC officers, however, is much greater than for the rest of the enlisted crew, and this cost is related to their proficiency bonus. For salaried officers and droid officers, the initial and ongoing costs are shown in the **Officer NPC Costs** table below.  Officer NPC crewmembers typically have a proficiency bonus equal to the tier of the starship plus one (minimum +2), an intelligence modifier also equal to the tier of the ship (minimum +1), and ranks in deployments also equal to the tier of the ship (minimum of 1).

## Start-Up Procedure

Starting up a starship requires many systems to boot, diagnostics to run, and mechanics to warm-up. Before becoming fully operable, a ship must start-up by completing 10 initiation procedures. When not under stress, a crew can take an amount of time shown in the **Starships Start-Up Time** table below to carefully complete these initiation procedures, resulting in automatic success. 


#### Starships Start-Up Time

<div style='column-count:2'>

|Ship Size |Start-Up Time|
|:--|:--|
|Tiny | 1 minute |
|Small | 2 minutes |
|Medium | 5 minutes |

|Ship Size |Start-Up Time|
|:--|:--|
|Large | 10 minutes |
|Huge | 30 minutes |
|Gargantuan | 60 minutes |

</div>

&emsp;When under duress, such as in combat situations, a pilot can lead their crew through an emergency start-up procedure by having a number of crew equal to the minimum crew size spend an action to complete initiation procedures.  On their turn, the crewmember leading the effort makes an Intelligence (Piloting) check as an action on their turn, and then consults the **Start-Up Procedures Results** table.

#### Start-Up Procedures Results
|d20|	Result|
|:--:|:--|
|9 or lower | Your procedures fail, resulting in no completed initiation procedures.|
|10-15 | Your procedures are adequate, resulting in one completed initiation procedure.|
|16-20 | Your procedures include a breakthrough, resulting in two initiation procedures.|
|21-25 | Your procedures are excellent, resulting in three completed initiation procedures.|
|26-29 | Your procedures are masterful, resulting in four completed initiation procedures.|
|30+   |Your procedures are perfect, resulting in five completed initiation procedures.|

Additionally, the ease of the check is affected by the state of repair of the ship. If the ship has maximum hull and shield points, the crewmember has advantage on the check. If the ship has less than its maximum hull points, however, they have disadvantage on the check.

<div style='margin-top:29px'></div>

&emsp;You may choose to penalize your Intelligence (Piloting) check on each turn by 5 before making them in order to reduce the crew needed to perform the Start-up by half.  

Alternatively, you may gain a +5 bonus on your Intelligence (Piloting) check if you have at least 1.5 times the minimum crew size completing initiation procedures.


### Hazards of a Cold Start
A start-up procedure, even an emergency one, can always be rushed, being made before all ten initiation procedures are completed, but such recklessness can be incredibly dangerous. If a ship takes off before a start-up procedure is completed, consult the Start-Up Mishaps table below. For every complete initiation procedure, add 1 to your roll on the table below. If you roll a 1 on your die, you roll again on the table in addition to suffering the indicated penalty.  If you take off without *any* initiation procedures and roll a 20, your ship is unscathed, but starts with no power dice available.  Power dice then regenerate using standard rules in later rounds.

> #### Delayed Penalty
>
> In certain circumstances, a GM may choose to roll secretly on the Start-Up Mishaps table and delay application of the penalty for dramatic effect.


#### Start-Up Mishaps
|d20|Result|

|20+    |    The ship suffers no adverse consequences.|
|18-19  | The ship's navcomputer is disabled until the<br> ship recharges. |
|15-17  | The ship gains one level of slowed until the<br> ship recharges. |
|12-14  | The ship is blinded until the ship recharges.|
|9-11 | The ship gains one level of system damage.|
|6-8  | The ship gains two levels of system damage.|

## The Environment
Starship exploration involves delving into the potentially dangerous, uncharted territory. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers, and their ships, interact with the environment. The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules covering more unusual situations.

### Vision and Light
The most fundamental tasks of starfaring&mdash;noticing danger, finding hidden objects, and hitting an enemy ship in combat, to name just a few&mdash;rely heavily on a ship's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, dust clouds, or electrical storms, ships have disadvantage on Wisdom (Scan) checks.

A **heavily obscured** area-such as darkness, opaque gases, or dense asteroids-blocks vision entirely. A ship in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix A).

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

**Bright light** lets most ships see normally. 

**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, and surrounding darkness. 

**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area. 


#### Blindsight
crewmembers on a starship equipped with an enhanced scanner (Scanner, Premium) can perceive their surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. 

#### Truesight
More advanced scanners (Scanner, Renowned) offer truesight, allowing crewmembers to detect starships that are completely invisible. Truesight allows a starship's scanners to automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them.

## Recharging and Refitting  
Over time, wear and tear on a ship accrues, forcing adventurers to temporarily abandon their pursuits to recharge and refit their ships. 

### Recharging
As long as a ship has the requisite crew, they can conduct makeshift repairs and the systems of the ship can reset and recharge themselves without the ship having to dock. Recharging the ship requires a workforce as shown in the **Starship Size Equipment Workforce** table on page 79, and takes 1 hour.

If conducting repairs is interrupted for more than an hour, the workforce must begin recharging again for the ship to gain any benefit from it.

Once recharging is completed, a crewmember can attempt to spend one or more Hull Dice by making an Intelligence (Mechanic's kit) check. On a roll of 10 or less, you roll the Hull Die twice and take the lesser amount. On a roll of 11 to 20, you roll the Hull Die normally. On a roll of 21 or higher, you roll the Hull Die twice and take the greater amount.

Whenever a Hull Die is spent to regain hull points, a crewmember rolls the die and adds the ship's Constitution modifier to it. The starship regains hull points equal to the total. The crew can decide to spend an additional Hull Die after each roll.

Additionally, all shield points and half of the ship's Shield Dice are restored at the end of the recharging period.  


### Refitting
Refitting is a period of extended downtime that requires docking at a spaceport or shipyard. Refitting costs a number of credits proportionate to the number of hull dice missing. The amount is 100 credits per hull die multiplied by the **Starship Size Upgrade Cost** table on page 22. Refitting requires a workforce as shown in the **Starship Size Upgrade Workforce** table on page 22, and takes an amount of time depending on the size of starship, as shown in the **Starship Size Refitting Time** table below.  

At the end of refitting, a ship regains all lost hull and shield points, expended Hull Dice and Shield Dice, and its system damage level is reduced by 1.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

#### Starship Size Refitting Time
|Starship Size|Time&nbsp;&nbsp;|
|:--|--:|
|Tiny|4 hours|
|Small|8 hours|
|Medium|1 day|
|Large|3 days|
|Huge|1 week|
|Gargantuan|1 month|

#### Repairing the "Used" Condition
If the ship was "used" at the start of refitting, the foremost mechanic can make a DC 30 Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check. On a success, the cost of refitting is increased, and the ship is no longer "used".

Repairing "used" costs a number of credits proportionate to the ship's maximum number of hull points. The amount is 10 credits per hull point multiplied by the **Starship Size Upgrade Cost** table on page 22. 

### Primary System Failure
In some instances, primary systems can experience failure. When primary systems fail, an integrated emergency back up will activate. This back up can continue running the starship, provided there is adequate fuel, for 24 hours. At the end of the 24-hour period, primary systems fail, causing all electrical systems, including life support to fail. 

Once a ship's primary systems fail, all functionality of the ship ceases to function. If the ship can be towed to a shipyard, it can still be repaired, however.

#### Repairing Primary Systems
If the ship's primary systems had failed at the start of refitting, they can be repaired during that refitting, increasing the cost but not the time.

Repairing primary systems costs a number of credits proportionate to the ship's maximum number of hull points. The amount is 10 credits per hull point multiplied by the **Starship Size Upgrade Cost** table on page 22.
