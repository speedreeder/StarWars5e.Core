<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/4mYR4C0.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:30px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;haracters are nothing without their ships, which<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;serve as a great source of inspiration and motivation for their adventures. The starship can even be the adventure itself.

The first step is acquisition.

## Acquiring a Ship
Many parties might see fit to merely obtain passage on a vessel as a part of their adventures, and there's nothing wrong with that. Others will want to obtain their own ships as fast as possible as it is a core component to their character. It is at the discretion of the GM to determine when a party should obtain their first starship using one of the following options.

### Joining a Faction
Joining a large faction, such as the Galactic Republic or the Empire might merit the acquisition of a personal starship. Generally, the faction still owns the ship and allows the party to use it as long as they are in accordance with the faction's wishes. Refusing missions or violating the faction's rule may lead to disavowment, pursuit, and eventual repossession of the ship. 

### Shipjacking
The most nefarious (and frankly most enjoyable) way to acquire a starship is to steal one. Shipjacking is an old and extremely dangerous profession. Starport authorities (as well as the original owners) are constantly on the lookout for stolen ships, and if the heroes fail to adequately falsify documentation identifying themselves as the ship's owners, they can find themself in an uncomfortable position.

### Purchasing
The most common method of acquiring a ship is by purchasing. The cost of a brand new "stock" starship can be found below, on the Starship Size Stock Cost table.

##### Starship Size Stock Cost
| Starship Size | Tier 0 Cost&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
|:----:|----:|
| Tiny  | 10,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Small  | 50,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Medium  | 100,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Large  | 1,000,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Huge | 100,000,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Gargantuan | 1,000,000,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|

How the players afford the ship varies as well. They may be patient, earning the credits to make the purchase over time. Alternatively, they might seek a backer, or a loan through a financial institution.

> Newly constructed starships come with a number of vacant modification slots, which can be filled with modifications, which are discussed in Chapter 4.

\columnbreak

#### Financing
The party could seek the assistance of a financial institute to purchase a starship. Generally, the bank will require 20% of the starship's cost as a down payment, with monthly payments equal to 2% of the cost for the following five years. 

#### A Wealthy Sponsor
Alternatively, the party may be granted the favor of working for a specific wealthy individual, such as a rich aristocrat. Convincing such an individual to finance you, however, can be quite the adventure in-and-of itself. Generally you can only obtain a sponsor if you can prove the relationship will be mutually beneficial.

#### Loan Sharks
As a less appealing (but potentially more interesting) option, the party could seek out a loan shark or an affluent gangster to finance a ship's acquisition. This usually requires less money up front, but requires steeper loan payments (typically 10% of the starship's cost each month for 3 years).

### Building a Ship
Building a ship is generally cheaper than buying it, but requires substantially more effort and patience; building takes time and necessitates use of a shipyard and a substantial workforce. If players elect to build a stock starship instead of purchasing one, it requires half the cost of the finished ship in facilities, labor costs, and raw materials. Additionally, it requires a minimum workforce as shown below on the Starship Size Building Workforce table. Ship construction also has a maximum practical workforce equal to five times its minimum.

##### Starship Size Building Workforce
| Starship<br> Size | Minimum<br> Workforce |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | 3 |
| Small  | 5 |
| Medium  | 10 |
| Large  | 100 |
| Huge | 1,000 |
| Gargantuan | 10,000 |

The amount of time it takes to build a ship depends on the size of the ship and the size of the workforce, calculated as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**time (in days) = ("starship size construction cost") / (500 x "size of workforce")**

</div>

___

For instance, to build a Small ship, with a workforce of 5, would take 20 days. To build a Huge ship, with a workforce of 1,000, however, would take 200 days [100,000,000 / (500 x 1,000)].

It is assumed each member of the workforce works 8 hours per day.  A workforce more than double the min-imum workforce must work in shifts for further gains.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | STARSHIPS</div>

\pagebreakNum

## Upgrading a Starship
Once the party has acquired a ship, they can upgrade it over time. Upgrading a ship is a matter of workforce, time, and skill. This assumes the starship you are upgrading is otherwise fully functional (has no missing hull points or damaged systems), the requisite resources and tools are freely available, and you are docked at a spaceport or shipyard. Under less optimal conditions the time, money and skill required could be increased by as much as 100%, and the GM may decide that an upgrade is impossible in these circumstances.

In addition to the cost of modifications and equipment, players can invest credits into their starships, eventually hitting certain thresholds that improve the tier of the ship.  Achieving higher tiers requires scarcer materials, restricted schematics, and master craftsmen; consequently, it costs more credits As a player increases the tier of their starship, they unlock additional Hull and Shield Dice, and unique size-specific features. The number of credits a party must invest in their ship varies based on the tier they are trying to obtain, as show below in the Base Upgrade Cost by Tier table.

##### Base Upgrade Cost by Tier
| Tier | Cost in Credits | Description of Rarity |
|:----:|:----:|:----|
| 0 | 0         | Mass Production (Standard) |
| 1 | 3,900     | Modified (Premium) |
| 2 | 77,500    | Fully Customized (Prototype) |
| 3 | 297,000   | Highly Sophisticated (Advanced) |
| 4 | 620,000   | State of the Art (Legendary) |
| 5 | 1,150,000 | Unique (Artifact) |

### Cost Modifiers
It costs more to upgrade the hull of a capital ship than the hull of a starfighter; bigger starships are simply costlier to improve. Consequently, each starship has a cost modifier depending on the ship's size, as shown in the Starship Size Upgrade Cost table below, which is multiplied by the value for that tier in the Base Upgrade Cost by Tier table.

##### Starship Size Upgrade Cost
| Starship Size | Cost Modifier |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Tiny  |&emsp;&emsp;x 0.5 |
| Small |&emsp;&emsp;x 1 |
| Medium |&emsp;&emsp;x 2 |
| Large |&emsp;&emsp;x 10 |
| Huge |&emsp;&emsp;x 100 |
| Gargantuan |&emsp;&emsp;x 1,000 | 

For instance, to upgrade a Small size ship from Tier 0 to Tier 1, it costs 3,900 credits. To upgrade a Huge size ship from Tier 2 to Tier 3, however, it costs 29,700,000 (297,000 x 100).

\columnbreak 

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div> 

### Upgrade Workforce
Additionally, bigger ships require more people to perform these upgrades. For a Small ship, a single person can do everything necessary (though additional workers will reduce the time taken), while a Medium or larger ship requires a more extensive workforce, as shown below in the Starship Size Upgrade Workforce table below.

##### Starship Size Upgrade Workforce
| Starship Size | Minimum Workforce |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | 1 |
| Small  | 1 |
| Medium  | 5 |
| Large  | 50 |
| Huge | 500 |
| Gargantuan | 5,000 |

### Upgrade Time
With sufficient workforce, a snubfighter can be upgraded in no more than a week's time. However, upgrading a freighter can take up to a month, and an overhaul of a large ship such as a cruiser might take a year. It isn't practical for a smaller workforce to make changes to such big ships, regardless of how much time the workers have.

The base time needed to upgrade a starship is calculated as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**time (in days) = ("base upgrade cost by tier" x "starship size upgrade cost") / (500 x "size of workforce")**

</div>

___

For instance, to upgrade a Small size ship from tier 0 to tier 1, with a workforce of 3, would take 2.6 days. To upgrade a Huge size ship from Tier 2 to Tier 3, with a workforce of 500, however, would take 118.8 days [(297,000 x 100) / (500 x 500)].

It is assumed that each member of the workforce works 8 hours per day.

> Some starship features are only usable once per round. Once they have been used by a deployed crew member, they are not available for use again until the start of that crew member's next turn.

### Starship Tier Features
Once players have upgraded a ship to tier 1 or higher, they unlock additional features, determined by the ship's size.

## Tiny Ships

<span style="font-variant: small-caps">As the droid fighter ducked and weaved through flying </span>  
blaster bolts and dodged the occasional flak, its optical sensors continued to become more and more occluded as they accumulated a dark haze of dust and smoke.  Switching to active radar systems, the droid continued to relentlessly pursue its target: the fleeing Jedi and its small padawn that was barely larger than a youngling. Not that it mattered.  Whether either target continued to draw breath a few seconds from now didn't really matter to the droid.  Of course, that cessation was its goal, but it didn't really care about that goal...it's just what it was doing.  What it had to do.  But not exactly what it *wanted* to do.  The droid passed power from its fully charged weapon's capacitors into its guns, which blazed to life and spewed plasma towards the small child's back.  It was a perfect shot.  How could it not be.  That's what it did.  Then the Jedi's own plasma weapon flared as it darted across the youngling's back, deflecting the droid's blasts directly back at it.  Of course, *that* is what *Jedi's* did.  And as the bolts tore through the droid ship's hull, into its main computer banks, across its power banks and out its engines, the droid's final computations let it know that it was plummeting to the earth at terminal velocity.  It's just what it was doing.  What it now had to do.  But not exactly what it *wanted* to do.

<div style='margin-top:572px'></div>

The small drone slips silently past the blockade, scanning the defensive formations as it goes.  The only chance to save the people on embattled Neth-Feeno was to coordinate a supply drop with them.  This little, remote-controlled stealth ship was their only hope.  It had to reach the surface to get the plan and maps through.  Then it had to return with a full readout of the defenses.  Only then could a distracting assault be planned to cover the air drop.  As the tiny craft floated past the final sensor pod mounted right next to the final turret canon, the monitoring crew let out a sigh, and wiped sweat from their brows.  As their screens, already more static than signal, winked out as the craft's transmissions were cut-off as it passed completely into the black-out zone, the team leader turned to his squad and said, "May the force be with us today."

One thing all Tiny starships have in common is that they are unmanned. Sometimes they are controlled remotely, but more often they are controlled by droids.

Arsix, behind him, beeps and whirs, preparing the ion pulse missiles for the attack run, pre-warming their engines and arming the warheads.  Together a long time now, Beskin and Arsix had spilled their share of blood and oil, respectively, for the Rebellion--usually just while improving their ancient Y-wing. But today, the blood and oil spilt wouldn't be their own.  As Zik let fly a pair of missiles, he knew they would find their target. Today wasn't over just yet.

 

This was her fourth sortie of the day, and Sheena was tired.  The terrorists just kept coming.  Every time she was about to shut her eyes a new wave of the Rebels came.  And every time they did, she rushed to her TIE Interceptor and joined the alert fighters to take the fighters down before they could blow a hole in the planet's defenses.  Every time they retreated before suffering heavy losses.  But every time they came back.  This last time she had decided to just nap in the cramp-

 ed cockpit, so when the claxon rang out, she and her ship were basically ready to fly.  This time she was go-ing to end them quickly.  As she repeatedly squeezed her trigger, she executed Koiogran turns and snap rolls galore, her laser blasts striking true, and the debris of A-wings, X-wings, and B-Wings--along with some frozen traitor remains--floated in space the next few days.  At night, she leaned back against her beau, sipping some wine and watch-ing the beautiful streaks of light cross the sky as, piece by piece, the wreckage burned up in the atmosphere during reentry.

R5-S1 locked down the loose stabilizer with his gripper arm as he angled the X-Wing's deflector shields.  This ship took a firm gripper to get under control, but R5-S1 was up to the task.  As his pilot, Veets, fired his last blast from the overheating cannons on the deployed s-foils, R5-S1 did the work of cooling off the guns, spooling up the hyperdrive, and running the calculations for lightspeed.  It was time to go.

Small ships have a tiny crew, often only a pilot and perhaps an astromech, but often strike above their weight class, a threat to small and large ships alike.

### Starship Improvements
Beginning when your ship reaches 1st tier, it gains the following benefits:

#### Ability Score Improvement
At 1st tier, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th tier, you can increase one of your ship's ability scores by 2, or you can increase two of these ability scores by 1. You can't increase your ability scores other than Dexterity above 20, or your Dexterity above 22, with this feature.

#### Additional Hull and Shield Dice
Your ship gains 1 additional Hull Die and one additional Shield Die. It gains 1 additional Hull Die and one additional Shield Die at 2nd tier (2, each), 3rd tier (3, each), 4th tier (4, each), and 5th tier (5, each).

### Pinpoint Strike
Also at 1st tier, your starship gains the ability to slip underneath the shields of an enemy ship.

When your ship occupies the same square occupied by a target ship and the pilot makes an attack roll, as a reaction, the pilot can, before rolling the attack, roll a Pinpoint Strike die, which is a d4, and add it to the attack roll.  If the attack requires a saving throw instead, you may subtract the Pinpoint Strike die from the target's save result.  On a hit, the attack deals normal damage that bypasses any shields and directly hits the hull of the target ship. This feature can only be used by the pilot, and it can only be used once per round.

Your ship’s Pinpoint Strike die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship’s tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

\pagebreakNum

### Role Specialization
At 2nd tier, you adopt a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

#### Bomber
Your ship gains a +1 bonus to damage rolls with ship weapons.

#### Interceptor
Your ship's flying speed increases by 50 feet.

#### Scout
Your ship gains a +1 bonus to Wisdom (Scan) and Intelligence (Probe) checks.

#### Scrambler
Your ship's crew can use interfere as a bonus action.

#### Shuttle
Your ship gains one suite system of your choice at no cost. Your Starship Size Suite Capacity is 2. 

#### Strike Fighter
Your ship gains a +1 bonus to the attack rolls and save DCs of its ship weapons.

### Retro Thrusters
Also at 2nd tier, when an attacker that a deployed pilot or operator can see deals damage to your ship with a weapon, they can use their reaction to immediately move the ship up to 50 feet in a direction of their choice, halving the damage your ship takes. The orientation of the ship does not change.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.

### Versatile Snubfighter
Starting at 3rd tier, when a deployed crew member makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A deployed crew member can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.

### Maneuvering Jets
Also at 3rd tier, your ship can add half of its Dexterity modifier (rounded down, minimum of one) to its armor class.

### Role Mastery
At 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

#### Bomber
Starships one or more sizes larger than you have disadvantage on saving throws against your tertiary and quaternary weapons.

#### Interceptor
Your ship's turning speed decreases by 50 feet. If this would decrease your ship's turning speed to 0, instead your ship's flying speed increases by 50 feet.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:22px'></div>

#### Scout
Your ship gains a +2 bonus to Intelligence (astrogation) checks and enemy ships have disadvantage on Wisdom (scan) checks to detect your ship entering and exiting hyperspace.

#### Scrambler
Your ship gains a +2 bonus to Charisma (interference) checks.

#### Shuttle
Your ship gains one suite system of your choice at no cost. Your Starship Size Suite Capacity is 2.

#### Strike Fighter
Your ship's shield regeneration rate is doubled.

### Standing By
Also at 4th tier, your ship can be pushed beyond its normal limits for a moment. On their turn, a deployed crew member can take one additional action on top of their regular action and a possible bonus action.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.

### Paragon Snubfighter
As of 5th tier, your starship is the best in its class. Choose from the following:

#### Bomber
Your ship's Wisdom score increases by 2.  It's maximum for this score increases by 2.

#### Interceptor
Your ship's Dexterity score increases by 2.  It's maximum for this score increases by 2.

#### Scout
Your ship's Intelligence score increases by 2.  It's maximum for this score increases by 2.

#### Scrambler
Your ship's Charisma score increases by 2.  It's maximum for this score increases by 2.

## Medium Ships
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">The freighter shudders with the blasts of cannon fire. Despite</span> its maneuvers, the pilot can't quite shake the pursuit. The technician's efforts to reinforce the shields are failing.  The mechanic is pumping the reactor for every scrap of energy it can generate. The operator is frantically making the final few calculations for the jump to hyperspace.  Finally, just as the ship's shields dissipate, the pilot makes the gut call, jettisoning the illicit cargo. As it distracts and hampers the followers, the freighter shifts power to the thrusters and quickly flies away.

As the pirates activate their tractor beam to attempt to capture the weaponless frigate and its exotic wares, the gunboat escort intercedes. It flies in the line of the tractor, breaking the lock on the frigate, and unleashes a volley of cannon fire. The pirates, incapable of with-standing the salvo, drop the tractor beam and retreat.  As the gunboat pursues to be sure the pirates don't come back for a second bite at the apple, the crew finally locks on target and unleashes a long-range night-stinger missile, putting a permanent end to the pirates' illicit and unwelcome activities.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain invites his guests into his well-stocked cantina. He eyes the opposition as they take in his ship, assessing their reactions and noting their expressions.  Fully aware of the effect the opulent room has on the unprepared, he easily stifles his grin and gestures for the starry-eyed vis-itors to sit across from him. He indicates for the server to bring drinks as he casually leans back and puts his feet on the table, confident this deal will go his way.  He presses a button on the tiny remote in his hand, causing hidden panels to slide away and reveal his mostly-legal wares.  "So," he says, "just how many of these do you need, and where will I deliver them?"

Medium ships are the bread and butter of the close-knit group. They are large enough to accommodate all of the immediate needs of a crew, while at the same time being small enough to feel cozy.

</div>

### Starship Improvements
Beginning when your ship reaches 1st tier, it gains the following benefits:

#### Ability Score Improvement
At 1st tier, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th tier, you can increase one of your ship's ability scores by 2, or you can increase two of these ability scores by 1. You can't increase your ability scores above 20, with this feature.

#### Additional Hull and Shield Dice
Your ship gains 1 additional Hull Die and one additional Shield Die. It gains 1 additional Hull Die and one additional Shield Die at 2nd tier (2, each), 3rd tier (3, each), 4th tier (4, each), and 5th tier (5, each).


### Evasive Maneuvers
Also at 1st tier, when a deployed pilot rolls for initiative, they can immediately move the ship. This movement happens before the initiative order is determined.

The amount the ship moves is determined by rolling an Evasive Maneuvers die, which is a d4, and multiplying it by 50 feet. The ship then gains that many feet that it can move or spend to turn.

Your ship's Evasive Maneuvers die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to<br> 2 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.

If you jettison at least 50 tons of cargo, you can reroll the saving throw and must use the new roll. If you jettison at least 75 tons of cargo, however, you instead automatically succeed on the saving throw. Additionally, the area in a line 300 feet long and 100 feet wide behind your ship becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute.

#### Gunboat
Once per round, a deployed gunner can roll the weapon damage dice one additional time when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a ship attack.

## Large Ships
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Trapped in the capital ship's tractor beam, the ambassador</span> frigate moves slowly towards the cruiser. The crew struggles to squeeze more power out of their reactor while the few marines on board take positions next to the hatches, wiping sweat from their brows as they check and re-check their weapons. Finally, bringing all the power the ship has to bare, the frigate is able to break the hold of the tractor beam and regain its trajectory, slowly but surely increasing the distance, before finally escaping the planet's moon and being able to jump to hyperspace.  Shouts of joy echo down the ship's corridors and extra rations are ordered in celebration.

Engines burning brightly, the corvette sprints through the blockade, trying to minimize the amount of fire its meager shields will have to absorb.  Top and bottom turrets swivel to port, unleashing return fire against inbound interceptors.  The ground drops from under everyone's feet as the artificial gravity systems flicker for a second as a pulse weapon detonates nearby.  The high-pitched, distant whine of the reactor is barely audible over commands issuing from the bridge.  The visual readouts indicated that they were now past the picket line, and the interceptors appeared to be breaking off, unsure of their ability to take on the much larger ship without the support of their battle stations.  They'd made it.  Looking back at the scopes, the coordinator's head hung down.  They'd been the only ones to do so.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Pelta-Class Picket ship danced between the larger destroyers and dreadnaughts, it continued its near constant barrage of heavy laser cannon fire, interspersed with individual launches of concussion missiles and proton torpedoes directed at vulnerable parts of the opposing fleet.  If too many of those enemy guns came to bear on the the Pelta, it would be in trouble, but it's speed and it's relatively limited firepower made it a less-than juicy target.  For now.  But that is exactly what it's captain needed.  Just a few more clicks and they would be in a perfect flanking position, able to pound the engines of the flag ship as soon as it's shields were brought down by the bombing squad beginning their run now.

Large ships occupy the pinnacle of size for most private owner/operators in the galaxy.  Large ships require an extensive crew and are costly to maintain, but can pack quite a punch and may house various suites and operation centers that allow the ship to operate as an impressive and mobile base of operations for wealthy individuals and successful adventurers.

As the carrier leaves hyperspace, snubfighters deploy from its hangars in formations and move to intercept the space station's patrol fighters. Before the enemy craft have the opportunity to respond, the fighters fall upon them, quickly decimating their ranks. But before the snubfighters had even left the carrier, a second wave of small bombers had been prepping for takeoff.  As they spew forth from the hangars, they quickly lock on to the space station and launch proton bombs, pulverizing the station in minutes.

Minutes pass for the ship uneventfully, until finally a frigate lurches unceremoniously out of hyperspace into realspace in front of them.

## Gargantuan Ships
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">The smaller ships retreat into the shadow of the blockade</span> ship, fleeing an overwhelming foe. As the dread-nought's shields envelope them, they quickly turn and spring on their pursuers, utilizing the bulwark's shields as they unleash all of the firepower they have to bear.  Meanwhile, the blockade ship unleashes a storm of electromagnetic energy from its antenna array, cutting of communications between enemy ships, effectively isolating the incoming forces from their distant fleet and from each other.

In the center of the fleet, the command ship surveys the battlefield. Wherever the line wavers, the command ship quickly directs ships to reinforce. Finally, the formations of the enemy flag, and the command ship directs the fleet to capitalize on their failure as it determines and uploads targeting coordinates to its torpedo ships.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warship looms ominously over the battlefield as the two opposing armies crash. Despite the efforts of the enemy line, the warship closes into firing range of the capital ships.  Having already determined an ordered targeting precedence, the operating crew confirms final firing solutions for the gunners as they charge up the main super-weapon on the prow of the ship.  It unleashes its first devastating blast as the rest of its arsenal begins to lance out at secondary targets nearby.

Gargantuan ships are the dreadnoughts that strike fear into the hearts of the faithless. They are the embodiment of indomitable might: a symbol of total and complete control.

</div>

### Starship Improvements
Beginning when your ship reaches 1st tier, it gains the following benefits:

#### Ability Score Improvement
At 1st tier, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th tier, you can increase one of your ship's ability scores by 2, or you can increase two of these ability scores by 1. You can't increase your ability scores other than Constitution above 20, or your Constitution above 26, with this feature.

#### Additional Hull and Shield Dice
Your ship gains 2 additional Hull Dice and 2 additional Shield Dice. It gains 2 additional Hull Dice and 2 additional Shield Dice at 2nd tier (4, each), 3rd tier (6, each), 4th tier (8, each), and 5th tier (10, each).


### Superior Firepower
Also at 1st tier, your starship's firepower can overwhelm larger ships.

When a crew member deals damage to a Large or larger ship with a ship weapon, the crew member can increase the damage by rolling a Superior Firepower die, which is a d4, and add it to the damage roll (no action required).

Your ship's Superior Firepower die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to<br> 3 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes recharging.

\pagebreakNum

### Role Specialization
At 2nd tier, you adopt a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

#### Blockade Ship 
Your ship gains the Emergency Generator and Power Backup modifications at no cost. Additionally, your ships shields extend further around it. Whenever a friendly ship would take damage while within 500 feet of your ship, if the source of that damage is more than 500 feet away from your ship and your ship's shields are active, your ship's shields instead take that damage. If the damage reduces your ship's shields to 0, the protected ship takes any remaining damage.

#### Flag Ship
Your ship gains the Command Center suite and Tractor Beam modifications at no cost, which do not count against its total suite systems. Additionally, when a crew member deployed in a command center takes the Direct action, the target of the Direct action can reroll one of the dice once.

#### Industrial Center
Your ship gains two Workshop modifications at no cost, which do not count against its total suite systems.  Additionally, the speed at which goods are crafted in your workshops is doubled.

#### Mobile Metropolis
Your ship gains a Living Quarters suite and a Recreation suite at no cost, which do not count against its total suite systems. Additionally, the capacity of your Living Quarters are doubled.

#### Researcher 
Your ship gains the Laboratory and Workshop modifications at no cost, which do not count against its total suite systems. Additionally, Intelligence (Lore) checks on your ship are made with advantage.

#### Warship
Your ship gains two Fixed Hardpoint modifications at no cost. Additionally, your ship has a +1 bonus to damage rolls with ship weapons.

### Prime Doctrine
Also at 2nd tier, your starship strikes fear in your enemies. When crew members roll initiative, one crew member can attempt to frighten other ships. Each crew member deployed on a hostile ship must make a Wisdom saving throw contested by a Charisma (Menace) check. On a failed save, affected crew members have disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw they make each round for 1 minute. At the end of each of their turns, they repeat this save, ending this effect on a success. Additionally, on a successful save, they become immune to this feature for one day.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.

\columnbreak

### Versatile Dreadnought
Starting at 3rd tier, when a crew member makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A crew member can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to<br> 2 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Superweapon
Also at 3rd tier, your ship is equipped with a superweapon. As an action, a deployed operator can activate the superweapon, which has a limited firing arc, as described in Chapter 9. When activated, a beam of destructive energy forming a line 10,000 feet long and 100 feet wide blasts from the weapon. Each ship in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + the crew member's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 15d10 energy damage, or half as much on a successful one.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.

### Role Mastery
At 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

#### Blockade Ship
Your ship's shield regeneration rate doubles.

#### Flag Ship
A coordinator deployed in a command center can, as an action, issue an order to a Huge or smaller ship. That ship can immediately move up to its flying speed, and up to five crew members on that ship can use their reaction to immediately take an action.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.

#### Industrial Center
Your ship gains two Docking Bay suites at no cost, which do not count against its total suite systems. Additionally, the capacity of your docking bays are doubled.

#### Mobile Metropolis
Your ship's fuel capacity, as shown in the Starship Size Fuel Capacity table, and storage capacity, as shown in the Starship Size Storage Capacity table, doubles. Additionally, while traveling in realspace, your ship consumes half the amount of fuel as normal.

#### Researcher 
When you use your ship's Superweapon, you can alter its functionality. Instead of dealing damage, ships who fail a saving throw are blinded, shocked, and shocked for 1 minute. Ships who succeed on the saving throw suffer these effects until the start of the deployed operator's next turn, instead.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

#### Warship
When a deployed gunner on your ship rolls the maximum on a damage die for a ship weapon, they can roll an additional die.

### Citadel
Also at 4th tier, the capacity for all of your suites is doubled.  If a suite type's capacity was already doubled, its size is instead tripled from its standard size. Additionally, your starship's maximum capacity for fuel and consumables doubles, and civilians, crew members, and troopers aboard your starship have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid Exhaustion.  If the capacity for fuel and/or consumables was already double its standard amount, it is now triple its original capacity.


\columnbreak

### Paragon Dreadnought
As of 5th tier, your starship is the best in its class. Two of your ship's ability scores increase by 4, and its maximum for these scores increase by 4.  Another ability score increases by 2, and its maximum for this score increases by 2.


### Devastator
Also at 5th tier, as an action, a single crew member can give the ship the following benefits for 1 minute:
- Your ship has resistance to all damage.
- Your ship's ship attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

This effect ends early if the ship is disabled. Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes refitting.

## Variant: Space Stations
Players may decide they want to invest in a space station. Only size categories Large and larger are appropriate for space stations. If players elect to own a space station instead of—or in addition to—a starship, use the following rules. 

#### Armor Class
When calculating a space station's armor class, space stations receive a -2 penalty to their AC.

#### Stock Modifications
Your space station comes with the Central Computer, Makeshift universal system in addition to the other stock modifications.

#### Flying Speed and Turning Speed
The station's flying speed become 50 feet and it's turning speed becomes 100 feet, regardless of any bonuses or penalties. The station's flying speed and turning speed can never be increased or decreased.

#### Hull Points Per Hull Die
For each Hull Die a space station has, it gains 2 additional hull points.

#### Hyperspace Travel
Your travel time in hyperspace is doubled.

#### Modification Installation DC
Space Stations have a -10 adjustment to the DC to install a modification.

#### Starship Size Maximum Suites
The maximum number of suites a station can have (based on their size and constitution modifier) doubles. For instance, a Large ship with a 17 constitution (+3) has a maximum of 9 suites, and a Large station with the same constitution score instead has a maximum of 18 suites.
