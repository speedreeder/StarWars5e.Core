<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:30px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he starship marketplace on the planet of Kuat <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teems with a myriad of manufacturers trying to peddle their parts. Santhe engineers preach the benefits of their lightweight ship armors, while Czerka employees counter that reinforcement trumps speed. SoroSuub representatives propagate the destructive power of their heavy laser cannon across from BlasTech vendors demonstrating their rapid-fire laser cannon, which they tout as more consistent. Across this planet, and many others, ships and parts for myriad vessels are available for purchase.

This chapter offers choices of certain equipment types, to be used in conjunction with the starship upgrades featured in Chapter 4. The listed prices are those appropriate to ships of a Small size; when outfitting a ship of any other size, you'll want to apply the starship size equipment cost, as shown in the **Starship Size Equipment Cost** table below, which differs slightly from a similar table found in Chapter 4.

Like modifications, if PCs provide the workforce to install the equipment and invest their time, the final costs incurred to add equipment is only half that shown (just the material cost of an assembled piece of equipment). Moreover, one or more PCs can assemble a piece of equipment without the ship's presence being required by spending an amount of time assembling based on the material cost of the assembled piece of equipment (half the total installed cost) and by using raw materials equal to half the material cost of the installed equipment (one-quarter the total installed cost).

### COST MODIFIERS
Equipment for bigger starships is costlier to acquire and install than that for smaller ships. Consequently, each
starship has a cost modifier, derived from its size as
shown in the **Starship Size Equipment Cost** table below,
which is multiplied by the base cost of the item.  Because Ship weapons and ammunition only come in two size categories, their costs do not change based on the ship's size cost modifier.

##### Starship Size Equipment Cost 

<div style='column-count:2'>

| Starship<br> Size | Cost<br> Modifier |
|:----:|:---:|
| Tiny  |x 0.5 |
| Small |x 1 |
| Medium |x 2 |

| Starship<br> Size | Cost<br> Modifier |
|:----:|:---:|
| Large |x 5 |
| Huge |x 50 |
| Gargantuan |x 500 |

</div>

For instance, to purchase and install Deflection Armor on a Small size ship, it costs 3,100 credits. To purchase and install it on a Huge ship, however, it costs 155,000 (3,100 x 50).

### Equipment Workforce
Additionally, bigger ships require more people to install new equipment, as shown below in the **Starship Size Equipment Workforce** table below.

\columnbreak

##### Starship Size Equipment Workforce 

<div style='column-count:2'>

| Starship Size | Minimum Workforce |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | 1 |
| Small  | 1 |
| Medium  | 2 |

| Starship Size | Minimum Workforce |
|:----:|:----:|
| Large  | 5 |
| Huge | 50 |
| Gargantuan | 500 |

</div>

### Installation Time
With sufficient workforce, a snubfighter's equipment can be installed in no more than a week. However, installing a new equipment layout in a freighter can take up to a month, and an overhaul of a large ship such as a cruiser might take a year. It isn't practical for a smaller workforce to make changes to such big ships, regardless of how much time the workers have.

The base time needed to upgrade a starship is calculated as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**time (in days) = ("base cost of new equipment" x "starship size equipment cost") / (500 x "size of workforce")**

</div>

___

For instance, to install Deflection Armor in a Small ship, with a workforce of 1, would take 6.2 days. To install it on a Huge ship, with a workforce of 100, however, would take 3.1 days [(3,100 x 50) / (500 x 100)].

It is assumed that each member of the workforce works 8 hours per day.

## Cargo
One of the primary features of a starship is its ability to store and transport cargo. This capacity accounts for everything not directly mounted to the ship, such as consumables, extra fuel, and personnel.

### Cargo Capacity
Each ship comes with a capacity for a certain amount of cargo, depending on its size, as shown below in the **Starship Size Cargo Capacity** table.

##### Starship Size Cargo Capacity

<div style='column-count:2'>

|Starship<br> Size|Cargo<br> Capacity|
|:--:|:--:|
|Tiny|—|
|Small|2 tons|
|Medium|25 tons|

|Starship<br> Size|Cargo<br> Capacity|
|:--:|:--:|
|Large|500 tons|
|Huge|10,000 tons|
|Gargantuan|200,000 tons|

</div>

> #### Variant: Cargo, cargo everywhere
>
> If you want to add more realism to your ship's cargo capacity, consider this additional rule in your games.
>
> Every suite modification that does not explicitly grant cargo in it's text, grants an amount of cargo capacity, depending on the ship's size, equal to 1/5 the amount shown in the
**Starship Size Cargo Capacity** table.  However, the suite becomes unusable for its purpose if filled beyond 1/25 of the amount shown in the table.

## Armor and Shields

Different ships use different types of armor based on their size and maneuverability. Snubfighters typically use lighter weight armor giving them greater avoid-ance, while bombers focus more on absorption over maneuverability. In addition to armor, some ships have shields to give them a greater defensive advantage.

### Armor
Armor augments the AC and/or grants damage reduction to ships. All starships have access to armor without need of modifications, although there are modifications that upgrade this armor.

***Lightweight Armor.*** 
Lightweight armor is commonly used on smaller ships, allowing them to take full advantage of their quickness.

***Deflection Armor.***
Deflection armor offers a trade-off for a somewhat maneuverable but less bulky ship. A ship with Deflection Armor installed gains damage reduction, but limits the amount of Dexterity that can be applied to its Armor Class. 

***Reinforced Armor.***
Reinforced armor grants a ship significant damage reduction, but makes it less likely to avoid damage. 

#### Armor Class
The armor class of a ship is 10 plus (or minus) the ship's Dexterity modifier, plus the bonus from Tier upgrades, plus any other applicable bonuses. For example, if a Tier 2 (+1 bonus) small ship has a Dexterity of 16 (+3 modifier), and the ship is using lightweight armor, the ship has an armor class of 14 (10+3+1). 

#### Damage Reduction
Damage reduction (DR) is a static value that you subtract when you take damage (to hull or shields) if certain conditions are met. DR is expressed as a number. DR provided by armor only affects damage you take as a result of being hit by an attack roll, in the same way that AC only helps you avoid being hit by an attack roll.

If passive DR would reduce the damage you take to 0, you instead take 1 damage.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Shields
Some ships lack shields, though most ships have them. Shield points determine how strong a ship's shields are, while shield regeneration rate determines how quickly those shields regenerate.  All starships have access to shields without need of modifications.

***Base Shield Points.*** Your starship's base shield points is calculated like your's ship's maximum hull points. At Tier 0, your base shield points equal the highest roll of your first Shield Die, as well as the average roll for each additional Shield Die. You also add your ship's Strength modifier to each die. 

***Shield Capacity.*** The capacity of shields is calculated by multiplying the base shield points by the shield capacity. For instance, if a ship has 50 base shield points, then it would have 50 shield points with directional shields, 75 with fortress shields, and only 33 with quick-charge shields.

***Shield Regeneration Rate.*** Shield regeneration rate is represented by a set value.  Your ship may regenerate shields (no action required) once per round on the ship's turn by that value by expending a shield die without rolling it, up to the Shield Capacity. The shield regeneration rate is calculated by multiplying the maximum value of the ship's Shield Die by the shield regeneration rate coefficient. For instance, a Small ship (d6) regenerates 6 shield points at the start of the ship's turn with directional shields, but only 4 shield points with fortress shields (6 x 2/3).

***Shield Depletion.*** In the event that shield points are reduced to 0, they can no longer be regenerated passively. A ship's shields can only be restored by using the Regenerate Shields action, by completing a recharge, or finishing a refitting.

***Shield Dice Recovery.*** Half of a ship's Shield Dice are replenished after a recharge. 

#### Directional Shield
Directional Shields are the most commonly used and balanced shields on the market.

#### Fortress Shield
Fortress shields offer a higher maximum shield points, but regenerate slower than normal shields.

#### Quick-Charge Shield
Quick-Charge Shields, opposite of Fortress Shields, offer a reduced capacity, but rapidly replenish.

## Ship Power
Ships have different power generation, distribution, and storage systems based on their energy consumption needs.  Excess power can be used to fuel special abilities.

### Power Dice
Crewmembers can use a ship's power die to fuel special abilities granted by ranks in a particular deployment role.  A power die is expended when a crewmember uses it, and can be used when stored in the system listed in the ability or in central storage.

The size of your ship’s power dice is determined by your ship’s tier, as shown below in the **Starship Tier Power Die Size** table. 

Your ship’s maximum power dice and how your power dice are stored are determined by your ship's power coupling.  How many power dice it recovers each turn is determined by your ship’s reactor. 

##### Starship Tier Power Die Size
|Starship<br> Tier|Power<br> Die Size |
|:--:|:--:|
|0|1|
|1|d4|
|2|d6|
|3|d8|
|4|d10|
|5|d12|

### Reactors
Ships use different reactor types based on their intend-ed uses. While the majority of commercial ships use standard reactors with average performance charac-teristics, some ships use more specialized reactor systems. Ships meant for endurance or stealth may use reactors optimized for fuel efficiency, while military craft often use reactors with greater fuel consumption and improved power output. 

***Power Die Recovery.*** At the start of each of your ship’s turns, it recovers a number of expended power dice, as shown in the Power Dice Recovery column of 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

the **Reactors and Power Couplings** table below.

#### Fuel Cell Reactor
Fuel cell reactors are the most common and balanced reactors on the market.

#### Ionization Reactor
Ionization reactors are highly fuel-efficient reactors that trade power output for fuel economy.

#### Power Core Reactor
Power core reactors have highly variable power output capabilities, but sacrifice fuel economy as a result.

### Power Coupling
Different power couplings are used in ships, often based on the number of crew expected to operate the ship.  Three power coupling models are in standard usage: direct power coupling, distributed power coupling, and hub & spoke power coupling.
These power dice are stored in a central and/or individual system capacitors to power abilities of crewmembers.  

***Power Die Storage.*** Your ship’s maximum power dice are determined by its storage, as shown in the two storage columns of the **Reactors and Power Couplings** table below. Power dice stored centrally can be used by any deployment abilities, while those stored in specific systems can only be used by abilities that reference that system. There are five systems used by Deployment abilities: communications, engines, shields, sensors, and weapons. Each system has its own storage capacity in distributed and hub & spoke architectures.

#### Direct Power Coupling
Direct power coupling has a central power capacitor that feeds power directly to each system.

#### Distributed Power Coupling
Distributed power coupling sacrifices flexibility by allocating power separately to each system.

#### Hub & Spoke Power Coupling
A hub and spoke coupling system combines attributes of both other systems, providing some flexibility and some increased power storage capacity.

## Weapons
Ships have weapon categories based on their determined function. Most snubfighters use laser cannons, while gunships have both railguns and lasers. Specialized ships often carry torpedoes or missile batteries, or even a bomb deployer. In order to install a weapon, your ship must have a vacant fixed or turret hardpoint modification.

Ship weapons are divided into four categories: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary. Properties vary based on the weapon's category.

In order to install a weapon onto a starship, the ship must have a vacant hardpoint modification onto which the weapon is installed. The hardpoint modification may be upgraded with a mounting type which can add new firing arcs (turret mounting, or broadside mounting modifications) or add a new way of firing (fire-linked mounting) to the weapon installed onto that hardpoint, as described in **Chapter 4: Modifications**.

> #### Weapon Installation: Start to Finish
> If your ship already has a vacant hardpoint, then you can simply install a weapon onto the hardpoint per the equipment installation rules described in this chapter and the process is complete.
>
> If your ship does not have any vacant hardpoints, then you must first purchase and install a hardpoint. If you want your weapon to have an unlimited firing arc, e.g., you purchase and install a hardpoint modification and a turret mounting modification (which has, as a prerequisite, the hardpoint modification). After installing the hardpoint per the modification installation rules in Chapter 4, you can now install the new weapon onto the hardpoint.


Ships have weapon categories based on their
function. Most snubfighters use laser
cannons, while gunships have both railguns and lasers.
Specialized ships often carry torpedoes or missile
batteries, or even a bomb deployer. 

### Primary Weapons
Primary weapons are the most common type that smaller ships carry: laser cannons. If a medium or smaller ship has any weapons, it has laser cannons. Laser cannons vary in effective range, rate of fire, damage, and damage type.

In a Huge or larger ship, primary weapons are
de-ployed in arrays called point-defense systems.
Rather than being Fired, point-defense systems are activated via their zone keyword and call
for Dexterity saving throws to avoid the weapon's
effects which apply to all ships entering or beginning
their turn in range of the point-defense system. If the
target fails the saving throw, they take the weapon's
normal damage. On a successful save, they take half of
the weapon's normal damage. A ship can not have
more than one of each type of point-defense weapon
in any firing arc.

***Range.*** The first number is the primary weapon's **normal range** in feet, and the second number indicates the primary weapon's **long range**. When attacking a target with a primary weapon beyond **normal range**, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

In a Huge or larger ship, when attacking a target with a primary weapon beyond **normal range**, they have advantage on the saving throw. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's **long range**. 

### Secondary Weapons
Secondary weapons are typically railguns or a small turbolaser on Large or smaller ships.  On Huge and larger ships, secondary weapons are the most common type of weapon, and typically take the form of turbolaser batteries. These weapons deal more damage and have a longer range than primary weapons, but they are more cumbersome. They are a common addition to gunships. 

In a Huge or larger ship, you have disadvantage to hit Large and Medium ships and cannot target Small or Tiny ships with secondary weapons.

***Range.*** The first number is the secondary weapon's **close range** in feet, and the second number indicates the secondary weapon's **normal range**. When attacking a target within **close range**, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. If you would already have disadvantage because a Huge or larger ship is firing at a Large or Medium ship, you roll the higher die a second time. When attacking a target beyond **close range**, but within **normal range**, you make the attack roll unaltered. You can't attack a target beyond the secondary weapon's **normal range**. 


### Tertiary Weapons
Tertiary weapons are limited-use weapons in the form of missiles, rockets or torpedoes. These weapons often have a long range, high accuracy, and massive damage potential but they are limited use and expensive to obtain. X-Wings are typically outfitted with proton torpedoes, for example. 

Rather than attack rolls, tertiary weapons call for Dexterity saving throws to avoid the weapon's effects. If the target fails the saving throw, they take the weapon's normal damage. On a successful save, they take half of the weapon's normal damage.  On a die result of "1" they treat the weapon's damage as if it had rolled the maximum.

Ships two or more sizes smaller than you have advantage on the saving throw.  Ships two or more sizes large than you have disadvantage on the saving throw.

***Range.*** The first number is the tertiary weapon's **normal range** in feet, and the second number indicates the tertiary weapon's **long range**. When attacking a target with a tertiary weapon beyond **normal range**, they have advantage on the saving throw. You can't attack a target beyond the tertiary weapon's **long range**.  

### Quaternary Weapons
Quaternary weapons are limited-use weapons in the form of bombs, charges, and mines. These weapons deal massive damage, but travel at slow speeds, and are costly to acquire. Y-Wings are typically outfitted with proton bombs.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 5 | EQUIPMENT</div>		

\pagebreakNum

Rather than attack rolls, quaternary weapons call for saving throws to avoid the weapon's effects. If the target fails the saving throw, they take the weapon's normal damage. On a successful save, they take half of the weapon's normal damage.

When released, quaternary weapons travel in a straight line at a rate of 100 feet per round, moving at the start of the firing gunner's turn. Quaternary weapons detonate when they physically connect with an object, when the firing gunner detonates them remotely using their reaction, or 1 minute after they are deployed.

When a crewmember takes the Fire action with a quaternary weapon, they can release a single loaded piece of ammunition. 

***Range.*** Quaternary weapons do not have a range. Instead, when Firing a quaternary weapon, the crewmember chooses whether to drop the ammunition in place or to launch the ammunition.  If launched, the ammunition travels in a straight line at a rate of 100 feet per round.

### Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the **Weapons** table.

#### Ammunition
You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. 

Weapons with the ammunition property come with a range in parentheses after the property. The range property varies based on the weapon type.

#### Auto
Automatic weapons only fire in burst or rapid mode.

#### Burst
A weapon that has the burst property can spray a 150-foot-cube area within range with shots. Each ship in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to ranged ship attacks).  On a failure, the ship takes the weapon's normal damage.  The ship takes no damage on a success. This produces an amount of heat or consumes an amount of ammunition as indicated by the burst number. If the ranged ship attack would have disadvantage, affected targets instead have advantage.

#### Constitution
A weapon with this special property requires more hull structure to securely hold and use and more cooling capacity to safely operate. While firing it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Constitution requirement.

#### Dire
Before you make an attack with a weapon with the dire property, you can choose to suffer a penalty to the attack roll up to the dire number. If you do so and you hit with it, you gain the same bonus to the damage roll.

\columnbreak

#### Explosive
When a ship is dealt damage by a weapon with the explosive property, creatures inside are forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.  The DC for the check equals 10 or half the damage taken by the ship, whichever number is higher.

#### Heavy
When you hit with an attack roll with this weapon, you deal additional damage equal to half your Strength modifier (rounded up, minimum of +1). Heavy is incompatible with saturate.

#### Hidden
You have advantage on Charisma (Swindle) checks made to conceal a hidden weapon.

#### Homing
A weapon with the homing property gives disadvantage on saving throws made within normal range.  Targets are not granted advantage on their saving throws for being at long range.


#### Ionizing
On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or it is ionized for 1 minute. As an action by a crewmember on their turn, the ship can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect early on a success. Ships larger than you have advantage on the saving throw.

#### Keen
When you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the keen property, the critical hit range increases by an amount equal to the keen number.

#### Melt
You may choose to forgo your proficiency bonus to your attack roll or suffer a penalty to the saving throw DC of the weapon equal to your proficiency bonus.  If you do so, on a hit, you may add your proficiency bonus to the damage result.

#### Overheat
A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the overheat property. A character must then cool the weapon using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).  A weapon will naturally cool over a period of ten minutes of non-use. 

#### Piercing
Before you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the piercing property, you can choose to gain a bonus to the attack roll up to the piercing number. If you do so, and you hit with it, you suffer an equivalent penalty to the damage roll.

#### Power
You can use a weapon that has this property to make a ranged attack without the use of ammunition. The weapon draws directly from the ship's power source.

Weapons with the power property come with a range in parentheses after the property. The range lists two numbers. The effect of these two numbers varies based on the weapon type.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 5 | EQUIPMENT</div>		

\pagebreakNum

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

#### Range
A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

#### Rapid
A weapon that has the rapid property can unload on a single target. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to ranged ship attacks). On a failed save, the target takes normal weapon damage, plus an additional amount equal to the weapon's damage dice. On a success, the target takes no damage. This produces an amount of heat or consumes an amount of ammunition as indicated by the rapid number. If the ranged ship attack would have disadvantage, the target instead has advantage.


#### Reload
A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A crewmember must then reload it. Reloading a weapon takes 1 minute per ammunition

#### SATURATE
When making an attack with a weapon with saturate,
you use your choice of your Strength or Wisdom
modifier for the attack roll or save DC. Saturate is incompatible
with heavy.

#### Special
A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see "Special Weapons" later in this section).

#### Vicious
Whenever you deal damage with a weapon with the vicious property and roll the maximum on a weapon damage die, you gain a bonus to damage equal to the vicious number.

#### Zone
Weapons with the zone property are activated with an action and persist until deactivated (no action required). The weapon creates a zone of difficult terrain within the firing arc and normal range of the weapon. Additionally, your ship has advantage on dexterity saving throws against tertiary weapons launched outside normal range of the weapon.

## Weapons by Size
In addition to the cost of the weapon varying by size, the damage dice and reload value for ammunition based weapons vary as well. There are two tables showing the various weapon systems that can be added to ships. The first is for size Tiny to Large ships, and the second is for size Huge to Gargantuan.  A third table lists the types of tertiary ammunition that can be used by the tertiary weapon systems.

\columnbreak

### Tertiary and Quaternary Weapons

#### Ship Weapons (Tiny-Large)
When scaling a tertiary or quaternary weapon to a size Tiny ship, reduce the reload number by half. When scaling a tertiary or quaternary weapon to a size Medium ship, double the reload number. When scaling a tertiary or quaternary weapon to a size Large Ship, quadruple the reload number.

For instance, a Cluster Pod Launcher for a size Tiny ship has a reload of 6; for a size Medium ship has a reload of 24. Meanwhile, a Bomb Deployer for a size Tiny ship has a reload of 2; for a size Medium ship the Bomb Deployer has a reload of 8.

The damage done by tertiary ammunition for ships sized Tiny, Small, Medium, and Large is shown in the "Damage" column of the **Tertiary Ammunition** table.  The number in parentheses is only used for ships sized Huge and Gargantuan.

#### Ship Weapons (Huge & Gargantuan)
When scaling a tertiary or quaternary weapon to a size Gargantuan ship, double the reload number. 

For instance, an Assault Cluster Pod Launcher for a size Gargantuan ship has a reload of 48. Meanwhile, a Bomb Deployer for a size Gargantuan ship has a reload of 16.

The damage done by tertiary ammunition for ships sized Huge and Gargantuan is shown in parentheses in the "Damage" column of the **Tertiary Ammunition** table.  The number outside the parentheses is only used for ships size Tiny, Small, Medium, and Large.

## Ammunition 
Tertiary and quaternary weapons require ammunition.  Values in brackets apply to Huge and larger ships.

**Tertiary Ammunition.** The ammunition for tertiary weapons varies based on the specific type of launcher attached to the hardpoint.

**Quaternary Ammunition.** The ammunition for quaternary weapons, while fire-able by the same bomb deployer, vary greatly in function. Regardless of their function, all quaternary ammunition has 1 hull point and an AC of 20. Upon destruction, all quaternary ammunition detonates. The damage value is appropriate for Tiny-Large ships, while the value in parentheses is appropriate for Huge-Gargantuan ships. 

### Ammunition Descriptions

#### Bomblets
When a bomblet detonates, each ship within 50 [100] feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 1d10 [2d10] energy damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

#### Conner Net
On a failed saving throw for a missile or upon detonation for a mine, a conner net deploys on the target, which must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, the ship is stunned for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a crewmember can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.  

#### DISCORD MISSILE
On a failed saving throw, the missile deploys pistoeka sabotage or “buzz” droids on the target. At the end of each of the target ship’s turns, the target ship gains one level of system damage if the target is medium or smaller [large or smaller]. As an action on each of their turns, a crewmember can have the ship attempt their choice of a dexterity or constitution saving throw (DC 15), ending the effect on a success.

#### EMP Bomb
When an EMP bomb detonates, each ship within 150 [300] feet must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, a ship is stunned for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a crewmember can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.  

#### Flechette Torpedo
A Flechette torpedo detonates at a point within range, creating a 200 (400) foot cube of difficult terrain.  Any ship entering or starting their turn in this area must succeed at a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15) or take 1d8 [2d8] kinetic damage.

#### Glop Bomb
When a glop bomb detonates, each ship within 50 [100] feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, a ship is blinded for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a crewmember can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.  Ships larger than you have advantage on their saving throw.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

#### Gravity Bomb
Rather than exploding on contact, gravity bombs detonate any time a ship comes within range of it. When a gravity bomb detonates, it attaches itself to the closest ship hull within 50 [100] feet, creating a mass shadow centered on the ship with a radius of 50 feet that lasts for 10 minutes.  A ship can attempt to dislodge the gravity bomb at the beginning of each ship turn by making a Strength saving throw (DC 15). Any Large or smaller [Gargantuan or smaller] ships with an attached gravity bomb are unable to activate their hyperdrives.

#### Gravity Mine
Rather than exploding on contact, gravity mines detonate any time a ship comes within range of it. When a gravity mine detonates, it creates a mass shadow centered on the point of detonation with a radius of 50 [100] feet that lasts for 10 minutes. Any ships touching this mass shadow are unable to activate their hyperdrives.

#### Proton Bomb
When a proton bomb detonates, each ship within 100 [200] feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 4d10 [8d10] energy damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

#### Proximity Mine
Rather than exploding on contact, proximity mines detonate any time a ship comes within range of it. When a proximity mine detonates, each ship within 100 [200] feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 2d10 [4d10] fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

#### Pulse Bomb
When a pulse bomb detonates, each ship within 200 [400] feet must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 2d10 [4d10] ion damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, it is ionized for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a crewmember can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.  Ships larger than you have advantage on their saving throw.

#### Seismic Charge
When a seismic charge detonates, each ship within 150 [300] feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 1d10 [2d10] kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

#### S-Thread Tracer
On a failed saving throw, the missile latches an S-thread tracer onto the target. When making an Intelligence (Probe) check to detect the S-threaded ship's hyperspace travel, its angle of departure can be detected on a roll of 15 instead of 25.

<div style='margin-top:514px'></div>

## Hyperdrive
The hyperdrive is a propulsion system that allows a starship to reach hyperspeed and traverse the void between stars in the alternate dimension of hyperspace. For a starship to have a hyperdrive, it must have a vacant hyperdrive slot modification.

The hyperdrive functions by sending hypermatter particles to hurl a ship into hyperspace while preserv-ing the vessel's mass/energy profile, and requires a functional hyperdrive motivator to do so. The vessel then travels along a programmed course until it drops back into normal space-realspace-at its destination.

A crewmember can engage the hyperdrive as an action, causing the hyperdrive to accept and use the calculations provided during astrogation. The designated pilot must spend at least 50 feet of your flying speed before the end of the ship's turn to move forward and enter hyperspace, otherwise the hyperdrive resets and must be re-engaged.

A hyperdrive's only function is to keep a vessel in hyperspace, and should a hyperdrive be forcibly deactivated or destroyed during transit, the ship will be violently pulled back into realspace.

Tiny ships rarely have a hyperdrive, while Small ships occasionally do. Medium and larger ships typically have a hyperdrive.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:537px'></div>

&emsp;The speed of a hyperdrive is rated on an inverse scale: the faster the hyperdrive, the lower the rating or "Class". Acting as a multiplier for a given base travel time then, a Class 2 hyperdrive takes twice the base time to travel a given route, while the Millennium Falcon's Class 0.5 takes only half the base time.

A ship can have multiple hyperdrives. Larger ships typically have a back-up in case of failure. Only one hyperdrive can be activated at a time. Your ship must have a hyperdrive slot for each hyperdrive.



##### Hyperdrives
|Name|Cost|
|:--|--:|
|Hyperdrive, class 0.5    |50,000 cr|
|Hyperdrive, class 0.75   |25,000 cr|

## Docking
All starships require refueling and restocking, as well as a place to dock where they can get these services.

### Docking Fees
Docking fees vary planet-to-planet, but typically average around 20 credits per day in an average spaceport for a Tiny or Small ship. For a Medium or larger ship, multiply the amount by the **Starship Size Equipment Cost** table.

For Large and larger ships, docking on planet is impractical. Typically, most civilized planets will have docking station in space that the characters can dock to. Alternatively, if they don't need to refuel or restock, they can simply remain in orbit and bypass any docking fees, while the party themselves transfer to the planet's surface in a smaller transport.

#### Long Term Storage
Long-term storage is available in some locations, averaging around 200 credits per month for a Tiny or Small ship. For a Medium or larger ship, multiply the amount by the **Starship Size Equipment Cost** table.

Again, it is impractical for a Large or larger ship to to be stored on planet. At large shipyards, long term storage might be available.

It generally requires about eight hours to get a ship out of long-term storage and ready for flight.

## Refueling and Restocking
All ships require fuel to operate; without it, a ship is effectively disabled. In general, most starships refuel each time they put into port, and during refueling other essential ship consumables (such as water and oxygen) are restocked as well.

### Refueling
Ships consume fuel in terms of "units", the quantity of which varies by the size of the ship. A ship uses a unit's worth of fuel for one day of flight in realspace or hyperspace, after one hour of flight in atmosphere, or in a single jump to hyperspeed. Costs for a<br> unit's worth of fuel can be found below<br> on the **Starship Size Fuel Cost** table.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

##### Starship Size Fuel Cost
|Starship Size|Fuel Cost|
|:--|--:|
|Tiny|25 cr/unit|
|Small|50 cr/unit|
|Medium|100 cr/unit|
|Large|1,000 cr/unit|
|Huge|10,000 cr/unit|
|Gargantuan|100,000 cr/unit|

&emsp;Additionally, a ship can store an amount of fuel, as determined by its size, in the **Starship Size Fuel Capacity** table below.

##### Starship Size Fuel Capacity
|Starship Size|Fuel Capacity|
|:--|--:|

#### Primary Systems
When a ship refuels, their primary systems, such as electricity and life support, are also replenished. As long the starship has fuel remaining, primary systems function. 

### Restocking
Ships store food and beverage in terms of "portions", the quantity of which varies by the size of the ship. Each living creature aboard a ship consumes one portion per day spent aboard the ship. A portion costs 10 credits.
