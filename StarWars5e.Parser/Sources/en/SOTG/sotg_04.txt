<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/TP83mUX.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:76px;width:35px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s soon as heroes get theirs hands on a starship,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they want to modify it. The desire for faster hyperdrives, more weapons, better shields, and possibly even some space for smuggled goods generally comes before the first payment to a Hutt loan shark is due. Upgrading and modifying a starship gives players a sense of ownership that makes them more connected to a campaign, and it serves other useful purposes as well.

Heroes who want to improve a starship have a built-in reason to take risks to earn credits (or other rewards, such as the use of the repair bay of a grateful military group). Although *Star Wars* focuses on on heroic action-adventure over the cobbling together of credits for tinkering with a ship, many characters are simply more motivated if they know there's a material reward on the line. Furthermore, a starship acts as a good base of operations, allowing heroes to have a place that seems like home even as they gallivant across the galaxy. Finally, as the heroes gain levels, a better-equipped ship prepares them for greater challenges.

## Modifying a Starship
When ships are produced, they are left with a certain amount of extra space, superstructure and power consumption leftover
to facilitate the addition of new system modifications and suites. In addition to the costs associated with acquiring raw materials, components and installation, each one of these modifications consumes one of a ship's modification slots. This section details all of the system modifications available to a ship. There are five categories of modifications:
- **Engineering**: These systems aid in mechanical function of the ship.
- **Operation**: These systems aid in operations and response function of the ship.
- **Suite**: These systems add population-based functionality to the ship.
- **Universal**: These systems passively augment the ship.
- **Weapon**: These systems add new weapon mounts, or improve existing ones.

When players acquire a new ship, it typically comes with minimal modifications already installed. Players then choose the modifications they want installed on their ship. Like construction and upgrading, installing new systems and modifying old ones takes materials, time, and a substantial workforce. Even with the requisite components, the GM may decide that a modification is inaccessible; it might only be obtainable if the heroes get hold of it directly, by recovering it from a supply depot, trading it off of a collector, or stealing it from the manufacturer. 

\columnbreak

The cost of a modification depends on the category from which it comes, as shown below in the Modification Category Cost table.

#### Modification Category Base Cost
| Modification Category | Base Cost |
|:----|----:|
| Engineering  | 3,500 cr |
| Operation | 3,500 cr |
| Suite | 5,000 cr |
| Universal | 4,000 cr |
| Weapon | 3,000 cr |

### Cost Modifiers
In the same way it costs more to upgrade a capital ship than a starfighter, it costs more to modify it as well. Each starship has a cost modifier depending on the ship's size, as shown in the Starship Size Modification Cost table below:

#### Starship Size Modification Cost
| Starship Size | Cost Modifier |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Tiny  |&emsp;&emsp;x 0.5 |
| Small |&emsp;&emsp;x 1 |
| Medium |&emsp;&emsp;x 2 |
| Large |&emsp;&emsp;x 5 |
| Huge |&emsp;&emsp;x 50 |
| Gargantuan |&emsp;&emsp;x 500 |

For instance, to purchase and install a Fixed Hardpoint in a Small ship, it costs 3,000 credits. To purchase and install one on a Huge ship, however, it costs 150,000 (3,000 x 50).

### Modification Workforce
Additionally, bigger ships require more people to perform modifications. For a Small ship, two people can do everything necessary (though additional staff will reduce the time taken), while a Medium or larger ship requires a more extensive workforce, as shown below in the Starship Size Modification Workforce table.

#### Starship Size Modification Workforce
| Starship Size | Minimum Workforce |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | 1 |
| Small  | 2 |
| Medium  | 4 |
| Large  | 10 |
| Huge | 100 |
| Gargantuan | 1,000 |

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Modification Time
With sufficient workforce, a snubfighter can be modified in no more than a week's time. However, a new modification layout in a freighter can take up to a month, and an overhaul of a large ship such as a cruiser might take a year. It isn't practical for a smaller workforce to make changes to such big ships, regardless of how much time the workers have.

The base time needed to modify a starship is calculated as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**time (in days) = ("modification category base cost" x "starship size modification cost") / (500 x "size of workforce")**

</div>

___

For instance, to install a Fixed Hardpoint in a Small ship, with a workforce of 2, it takes three days. To install one on a Huge ship, with a workforce of 100, however, it also takes 3 days.

It is assumed that each member of the workforce works 8 hours per day.

### Modification Tier Requirements
Finally, some modifications have a ship tier requirement. These modifications are more costly, using scarce materials to construct and install. When purchasing and installing a modification with a tier requirement, multiply the final cost of the modification by the modification's tier requirement.

Additionally, these modifications require more precise skill to install. When making a modification, the foremost mechanic must make an Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check to correctly install these modifications. The DC for the check varies based on the tier requirement of the modification, as shown below in the Modification Tier Requirement DC table below.

#### Modification Tier Requirement DC
| Modification Tier Requirement| DC |
|:----:|:----:|
| 1 | 10 |
| 2 | 15 |
| 3 | 20 |
| 4 | 25 |
| 5 | 30 |

On a failure, half the requisite time and cost is incurred, but the modification is not installed.

### Prerequisites
Some modifications have prerequisites that must be met before they can be installed. If you are installing two or more modifications at the same time, you can install a modification at the same time that you install its prerequisite. If the modification has a tier requirement, you can't install that modification until your ship reaches that tier.

If at any time you lose access to a modification's prerequisite, such as removal or ship damage, you can't use that modification again until you regain access to the prerequisite.

\columnbreak

### Ability Score Maximums
If a tier feature or modification would increase an ability score above its maximum without also increasing that maximum, you can instead allocate that additional ability score increase to another ability score.


### Changing Saving Throw Proficiency
When a starship is created, a saving throw proficiency is chosen from a list available to the starship. Later on, however, players may want to change their starship's saving throw proficiency to another of the available options. Changing a saving throw proficiency requires time and credits as if installing a new universal modification.

### Removing Modifications
Sometimes, characters might decide they want to remove a modification in favor of a new one. Removing a modification requires half the cost it takes to install the modification originally, and takes half the time.

If replacing the modification at the same time as removal, the cost to remove is incurred, but the additional time to remove is not required.

### Removing Tiers
Sometimes, characters might decide they want to change a selection made for a starship tier feature. To do so, they must remove the tier from the ship, reducing the ship's tier by one. Doing so removes all features from the ship earned at the new tier, including Ability Score Improvements, additional Hit Dice, and additional modifications.

Removing a starship tier requires have the cost it takes to upgrade to that tier, and takes half the time.

If upgrading the ship to the tier again at the same time as removal, the cost to remove is incurred, but the additional time to remove is not required.

### Starship Tier Features
If a modification is granted to your starship by a starship tier feature, such as the Role Specialization feature, that modification does not count against its total modifications, comes at no additional cost, and you can't voluntarily remove it. If your starship already has that modification, you may install an additional modification that is available to you.

### Modification Slots at  Tier 0
At tier 0, each ship comes with a number of vacant modification slots, depending on their size, as shown in chapter 3.

### Stock Modifications
Also at tier 0, each ship comes with a number of modifications, at no additional cost, which do not count against its total modifications or suite systems, depending on its size, as shown in chapter 3.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

## Engineering Systems
These modifications offer unique functionality to the ship. Each engineering system can be chosen multiple times.

Certain engineering systems mention a deployed mechanic's proficiency bonus. In order to add your proficiency bonus to these features, you must be proficient in mechanic's kits.

### Alternative Fuel Converter
Your ship is equipped with an alternative fuel converter which allows the conversion of materials to a potential fuel source. Over the course of 10 minutes, a deployed mechanic can make an Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check (DC  = 10 or half the number of days since the ship's last refueling, whichever number is higher). On a success, the ship recovers one day's worth of fuel.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Boarding Harpoon
_Prerequisite: Tier 2_<br>
_Prerequisite: Shock Absorbers_<br>
Your ship has been further modified with a massive grappling harpoon, through which creatures can pass. When a deployed pilot takes the Ram action, and the target fails the saving throw, they become harpooned. While harpooned, the target ship's flying speed is reduced to 0, and your ship's flying speed is reduced by half. Your ship's pilot can release the harpooned ship at any time (no action required). The harpooned ship is automatically released if your ship becomes disabled, or if it is forcefully moved more than 100 feet away from your ship.

***Removing the Harpoon.*** A harpooned ship's pilot can use its action to make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + the deployed mechanic's proficiency bonus + your ship's Strength modifier), ending the effect on a success.

***Moving a Harpooned Ship.*** When your ship moves, it can drag the harpooned ship with it, unless the ship is larger than your ship.

***Boarding a Harpooned Ship.*** While the ship is harpooned, up to six creatures of Medium size or smaller can move through the gap onto the harpooned ship each round.

***Recovering the Harpoon.*** Recovering and reinstalling the harpoon takes 1 minute.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

### Countermeasures
This modification adds a series of countermeasures to the ship, granting it a more active approach to ward off effects. Once per round, when your ship is forced to make a saving throw against an effect that would cause it to be blinded, ionized, shocked, stalled, or stunned, a deployed mechanic can use their reaction to add their Intelligence modifier to the roll (minimum of +1).

### Emergency Generator
Your ship is equipped with an emergency generator to recharge shields. When your ship is reduced to 0 shield points but not destroyed outright, a deployed mechanic can use their reaction to have it drop to 1 shield point instead. Alternatively, if the ship has 0 shield points, a deployed mechanic can use their action to restore shield points equal to twice their Intelligence modifier. 

Once either feature has been used, the power backup can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

### External Docking System
_Prerequisite: Ship size Medium or larger_<br>
Your ship is equipped with an airlock and couplers designed to attach and connect to another ship of at least one size category smaller. Over the course of 1 minute, a deployed mechanic can engage or disengage the external docking system. While a ship is coupled to your ship, the ships can share primary systems as appropriate, and creatures can transfer between ships readily. While a ship is coupled, your ship's flying speed is halved, it's turning speed is doubled, and it takes twice as long to travel in hyperspace.

### Feedback Shield
Your ship's shield is enhanced to reflect damage to would-be attackers. As a reaction to the ship being hit with a primary or secondary weapon, a deployed mechanic can use their reaction to deal damage to the attacking ship. The damage depends on your ship's size: 1d4 for a Tiny ship, 1d6 for a Small ship, 1d8 for a Medium ship, 1d10 for a Large ship, 1d12 for a Huge ship, or 1d20 for a Gargantuan ship. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the start of the deployed mechanic's next turn.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Flare Pods
Your ship is a equipped with a series of counter-measure flares. When your ship is forced to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, a deployed mechanic can use their reaction to release a flare. When they do so, your ship has advantage on the triggering saving throw. The deployed mechanic can choose to use this feature after the roll is made, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. If they already have advantage on the saving throw, they can instead reroll one of the dice once.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Improved Countermeasures
_Prerequisite: Tier 2_<br>
_Prerequisite: Countermeasures_<br>
This modification enhances your ship's countermeasures, allowing it to quickly clear lingering effects. As an action, a deployed mechanic can activate this feature, ending the blinded, ionized, shocked, stalled, and stunned conditions.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Interdiction Drive
_Prerequisite: Tier 1_<br>
You unlock an interdiction drive in your ship, which can be activated to impede ships around it. As an action, a deployed mechanic can engage the interdiction drive. Each ship within 100 feet of your ship must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + the mechanic's proficiency bonus + your ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship's flying speed is reduced by 100 feet and its turning speed is increased by 50 feet until the end of the mechanic's next turn.

If a ship is two or more sizes larger than your ship, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it is two or more sizes smaller, it instead has disadvantage. 

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

\columnbreak

### Invulnerability Drive
_Prerequisite: Tier 3_<br>
Your ship is equipped with an experimental device which can render it immune to all damage. As an action, a deployed mechanic can activate the drive. Once activated, the drive lasts for 1d4 rounds, granting the following benefits:
- Your ship is immune to all damage.
- Your ship's flying speed is reduced by half.
- Your ship's turning speed is doubled.

A deployed mechanic can end this effect at any time, no action required. When the effect ends, the deployed mechanic must make a Destruction saving throw. On a failure, the ship suffers 1 level of system damage.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Nano-Droid Distributor
Your ship is equipped with a nano-droid distributor that allows it to repair other ships. When a deployed mechanic takes the Patch action, they can instead repair another ship within 100 feet. You spend and roll one of your ship's Hit Dice, and the target ship regains that many hit points.

### Power Backup
Your ship is equipped with a back up battery, which can give it renewed energy. When your ship is reduced to 0 hit points but not destroyed outright, a deployed mechanic can use their reaction to have it drop to 1 hit point instead. Alternatively, if the ship is making Destruction saving throws, a deployed mechanic can use their action to automatically succeed on a Destruction saving throw.

Once either feature has been used, the power backup can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Self-Destruct Mechanism
Your ship is equipped with a self-destruct mechanism that can cause immense destruction at the expense of the ship. A deployed mechanic can activate the self-destruct mechanism as an action, setting a timer up to 10 minutes in length. When the timer expires, the ship explodes, dealing thermite damage to each enemy within range. The damage is calculated as follows; for each Hit Die the ship has, roll it and add the ship's Strength modifier to the roll. 

The range that the self-destruct mechanism impacts varies, depending on the ship's size:
- **Tiny**: A Tiny ship deals damage to each ship within 50 feet of it.
- **Small**: A Small ship deals damage to each ship within 100 feet of it.
- **Medium**: A Medium ship deals damage to each ship within 200 feet of it.
- **Large**: A Large ship deals damage to each ship within 400 feet of it.
- **Huge**: A Huge ship deals damage to each ship within 1,000 feet of it.
- **Gargantuan**: A Gargantuan ship deals damage to each ship within 2,000 feet of it.

### Shield Bleedthrough
_Prerequisite: Tier 2_<br>
Your ship's reactor is overhauled to give temporary boosts to your ship's weapon batteries. When your ship hits another ship with a primary or secondary weapon attack while it still has shield points, a deployed mechanic can use their reaction to cause some of the damage to bleed through. The damage the ship's shields take is reduced by an amount equal to your ship's Strength modifier. The ship's hull then takes this much damage. This damage is of the same type as the weapon's damage.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the start of the deployed mechanic's next turn.

\columnbreak

### Shock Absorbers
_Prerequisite: Ship size Medium or larger_<br>
Your ship has been modified to withstand sudden impacts, and to be more effective at ramming. When a deployed pilot takes the Ram action, and the target fails the saving throw, a deployed mechanic can use their reaction to increase the damage dealt by an amount equal to two of your ship's Hit Dice. Additionally, your ship has resistance to kinetic damage caused by ramming.

### Shocking Harpoon
_Prerequisite: Tier 4_<br>
_Prerequisite: Boarding Harpoon_<br>
Your ship's harpoon has been modified, allowing it to conduct bursts of energy into the harpooned ship. When a deployed pilot takes the Ram action, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw. Additionally, a harpooned ship has disadvantage on the Strength saving throw to remove the harpoon. Finally, as an action on each of their turns, a deployed mechanic can deal pulse damage to a harpooned ship. The damage is equal to one of your ship's Hit Dice + your ship's Strength modifier.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

## Operation Systems
These specialized modifications aid in the operation and response of the ship. Each operation system can be chosen only once.

Certain operation systems mention a deployed operator's proficiency bonus. In order to add your proficiency bonus to these features, you must be proficient in Technology.

### Active Camouflage
_Prerequisite: Tier 3_<br>
_Prerequisite: Stealth Mode_<br>
This system improves the stealth mode function on your ship. While active, your ship no longer has disadvantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on scanners, and no longer has to roll on the Hyperspace Mishaps table before entering hyperspace while stealth mode is active.

### Backup Hyperdrive
_Prerequisite: Hyperdrive Slot_<br>
This modification adds a backup hyperdrive slot on your ship and includes a class 15 hyperdrive. A deployed operator can switch to or from the backup hyperdrive as an action.

### Cloaking Device
_Prerequisite: Tier 5_<br>
_Prerequisite: Active Camouflage_<br>
This system massively improves the stealth mode function on your ship, becoming a true cloaking device. While active, your ship is invisible. Additionally, when your ship makes a Dexterity (Stealth) check while your cloaking device is active, it has advantage on the roll. If your ship already has advantage on the ability check, you can instead reroll one of the dice once.

### Communications Suppressor
_Prerequisite: Tier 1_<br>
This modification adds a device designed to suppress the communications of a planet, space station, or starship within 1 mile of your ship. As an action, a deployed operator can attempt suppress the target's communications by making an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Technology) check. On a success, the target's communications are suppressed, preventing any communication to or from external sources. On a failure, they become immune to this feature for one day.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

### Heavy Ion Cannon
_Prerequisite: Ship size Medium or larger_<br>
Your ship is equipped with a weapon designed to disable enemy ships without damaging them through use of an ion cannon that delivers a powerful electromagnetic burst. A deployed operator can fire the heavy ion cannon at a target as an action, which has a range of 1,000 feet and a limited firing arc, as described in Chapter 9. The target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + the operator's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship is stunned for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a deployed mechanic can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

If a ship is targeted by a ship two or more sizes larger than them, it has disadvantage on the initial saving throw. If targeted by a ship two or more sizes smaller, it instead has advantage.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Enhanced Communications
This modification augments the native communications on your ship. Deployed operators can now communicate in real time with any planets, space stations, and starships in the same sector as you as long as they are similarly equipped.

### Enhanced Scanner
This system augments the native radar scanner on your ship. While deployed at the scanner, operators gain blindsight out to 1,000 feet.

### Gravity Well Projector
_Prerequisite: Ship size Large or larger_<br>
Your ship is modified with a gravity well projector that prevents ships from jumping to hyperspace, and even pulls ships from hyperspace, through use of an interdiction field. A deployed operator can activate or deactivate the gravity well projector as an action, which has a range of 1,000 feet and a limited firing arc, as described in Chapter 9. While active, this ship and ships of the same size or smaller within the gravity well projector's firing arc can't activate their hyperdrives.

### Hyperdrive Quick-Start
_Prerequisite: Tier 2_<br>
_Prerequisite: Hyperdrive Slot_<br>
This modification improves the hyperdrive on your ship, reducing the time required to engage the hyperdrive by half.

Additionally, you can quick start the hyperdrive. As an action, a deployed operator can quick-start the hyperdrive. A quick-started hyperdrive engages faster than normal, and completes booting up at the start of the operator's next turn. Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Hyperdrive Slot
This modification adds a hyperdrive slot on your ship and includes a class 15 hyperdrive.

### Improved Communications
_Prerequisite: Tier 2_<br>
_Prerequisite: Enhanced Communication_<br>
This modification improves the native communications on your ship. Deployed operators can now communicate in real time with any planets, space stations, and starships in the same territory as you as long as they are similarly equipped.

Additionally, when your ship sends out communications, those communications can be encrypted, only understandable by recipients with the cipher. A deployed operator can encrypt communications by making an Intelligence (Technology) check, setting the decrypt DC. Another deployed operator can spend 1 minute attempting to decode the encrypted communications by making an Intelligence check against the decrypt DC. On a success, they decrypt the message. On a failure, they do not decrypt your encrypted message, and can't attempt to do so again for one day. 

Lastly, when another ship tries to suppress your communications, the deployed operator has advantage on the Intelligence (Technology) check made to contest it.

### Improved Scanner
_Prerequisite: Tier 2_<br>
_Prerequisite: Enhanced Scanner_<br>
This modification improves the radar scanner on your ship, granting advantage to the deployed operator on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on scanners.

### Improved Suppressor 
_Prerequisite: Tier 3_<br>
_Prerequisite: Communications Suppressor_<br>
This modification improves the communications suppressor by adding a decrypter. When a deployed operator makes an Intelligence check to decrypt another ship's encrypted messages, if they are proficient in Technology, they can instead make an Intelligence (Technology) check. Additionally, when a deployed operator attempts to suppress a target's communications, they have advantage on the roll.

\columnbreak

### Master Communications
_Prerequisite: Tier 4_<br>
_Prerequisite: Improved Communications_<br>
This modification massively improves the native communications on your ship. Deployed operators can now communicate in real time with any planets, space stations, and starships anywhere in the known galaxy as long as they are similarly equipped.

Additionally, the deployed operator has advantage on Intelligence (Technology) checks to encrypt a message. If they already have advantage on the roll, they can instead reroll one of the dice once.

### Master Scanner
_Prerequisite: Tier 4_<br>
_Prerequisite: Improved Scanner_<br>
This modification massively improves the radar scanner on your ship. While deployed at the scanner, operators gain truesight out to 1,000 feet.

### Master Suppressor 
_Prerequisite: Tier 5_<br>
_Prerequisite: Improved Suppressor_<br>
This modification massively improves the suppressor on your ship. When a deployed operator attempts to decrypt a message, they have advantage on the roll. Additionally, when a deployed operator attempts to suppress or decrypt, if they already have advantage on the roll, they can instead reroll one of the dice once.

### Navcomputer Quick-Calc
_Prerequisite: Tier 2_<br>
_Prerequisite: Navcomputer Slot_<br>
This modification improves the navcomputer on your ship, granting advantage to the deployed operator on Intelligence (Technology) checks made to calculate astronavigation.

Additionally, the deployed operator can overload the navcomputer to quickly calculate astronavigation. When they do so, if they have advantage on the Intelligence (Technology) check, they can reroll one of the dice once. Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Navcomputer Slot
This modification adds a navcomputer slot on your ship and includes a basic navcomputer.

### Secondary Transponder Code
_Prerequisite: Tier 2_<br>
This modification implements a secondary transponder code into your ship's sublight engines. This transponder code can differ from your primary transponder code in terms of ship's owner, designation, make and model, any registered modifications, and the ship's ownership history. A deployed operator can switch the ship's transponder code as an action. A creature can determine this transponder code is a fake by making an Intelligence (Technology) check (DC = 8 + your deployed operator's bonus to Technology checks). On a success, they determine that your transponder code is a fake.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Stealth Mode
_Prerequisite: Tier 1_<br>
This modification adds a stealth mode to your ship. While active, this device effectively negates the use of scanners, both for and against your ship. A deployed operator can activate or deactive the cloaking device as an action. While active, your ship has advantage on Dexterty (Stealth) checks that rely on scanners, but your ship has disadvantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on scanners.

Additionally, if you try to enter hyperspace while the cloaking device is active, you must roll on the Hyperspace Mishaps table on page 76.

### Sensor Dampener
This modification adds a remote sensor dampener to your ship. As an action, a deployed operator can attempt to dampen the sensors of a ship they can see within 1,000 feet. The target ship must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + the operator's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, the ship is blinded for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a deployed mechanic on the affected ship can repeat this save, ending the effect on a success.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Shield Disruptor
_Prerequisite: Tier 1_<br>
This modification adds a shield disruptor to a ship, which is used to interfere with another ship's shield. As an action, a deployed operator can activate the shield disruptor and choose a ship they can see within 1,000 feet. The target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + the operator's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, the ship's shield capacity and shield regeneration rate are reduced by half for 1 minute. If the ship's current shield points would exceed the new shield capacity, they are reduced accordingly. At the start of each of the target ship's pilot's turns it repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

If a ship is targeted by a ship two or more sizes larger than them, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. If tractored by a ship two or more sizes smaller, it instead has advantage.

You can end the shield disruptor at any time (no action required).

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

\columnbreak

### Tractor Beam
This modification adds a tractor beam to a ship, which can be used to grasp and guide vessels and debris. A deployed operator can activate the tractor beam as an action, which has a range of 1,000 feet and a limited firing arc, as described in Chapter 9. Each ship within the firing arc must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + the operator's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship is tractored for 1 minute and immediately gets pulled 100 feet towards the tractoring ship, without changing the ship's orientation. At the start of each of a tractored ship's pilot's turns, a tractored ship gets pulled 100 feet towards the tractoring ship, without changing the ship's orientation, and then repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

If a ship is tractored by a ship two or more sizes larger than them, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. If tractored by a ship two or more sizes smaller, it instead has advantage.

If you are attempting to tractor a ship larger than you, and the ship succeeds on the saving throw, you can instead use the tractor beam to tractor yourself to the ship, gaining the tractored condition.

You can end the tractor beam at any time (no action required).

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

## Suite Systems
Suite systems add additional functionality to the ship in the form of bays, stations and designated areas, offering increased utility to civilians, crew members, and troopers. Each suite system can be chosen no more than ten times. All suite systems require a ship of size Medium or larger. In addition to their modification slot cost, ships are limited to the number of suite systems they can have, depending on the ship's size, as shown below in the Starship Size Maximum Suites table.

#### Starship Size Maximum Suites
| Starship Size | Suite Capacity |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | — |
| Small  | — |
| Medium  | 4 |
| Large  | 8 |
| Huge | 15 |
| Gargantuan | 30 |

Additionally, unless otherwise specified, each suite system can accommodate a standard number of civilians, crew members, or troopers, as shown below in the Starship Size Suite Capacity table.

#### Starship Size Suite Capacity
| Starship Size | Suite Capacity |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | — |
| Small  | — |
| Medium  | 4 |

When you score a critical hit with the chosen weapon; when you have advantage on the attack roll and hit, and the lower of the two d20 rolls would also hit; when the target ship rolls a 1 on the saving throw to avoid the weapon's effects; or when the target ship has disadvantage on the saving throw and fails, and the higher of the two rolls would also fail, you can force the target to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, the ship is ionized until the start of your next turn.

If the damaged ship is larger than your ship, it has advantage on the saving throw. If the damaged ship is smaller than your ship, it instead has disadvantage.

### Pinpointing Addition
_Prerequisite: Primary or Secondary Weapon_<br>
The ranges of the chosen weapon of your choice increase by half. 

### Point Defense System
_Prerequisite: Ship size Large or larger_<br>
A point defense system is a array of dozens or hundreds of small arms which are linked to a single targetting AI with the purpose of shooting at any ships which come into short range. When a hostile ship comes within 100 feet of a point defense system or ends its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + the pilot's proficiency bonus + the ship's Dexterity modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 2d6 energy damage.

If a ship is in the area of more than one point defense system, it is affected only once.

On a failed save, the ship is shocked until the start of your next turn.

If the damaged ship is larger than your ship, it has advantage on the saving throw. If the damaged ship is smaller than your ship, it instead has disadvantage.

### Stunning Rounds

### Turret Hardpoint
_Prerequisite: Fixed Hardpoint_<br>
The Turret Hardpoint is a modification to a Fixed Hardpoint that grants an improved firing arc. The weapon attached to the chosen fixed hardpoint now has an unlimited firing arc, as described in chapter 9.

### Weapon Slave Array
_Prerequisite: Ship size Medium or larger_<br>
A weapon slave array is attached to a hardpoint and used to fire the weapon from the cockpit rather than the gunner station. Primary and secondary ship attack rolls are made at disadvantage, and tertiary weapon saving throws are made with advantage, when slaved weapons are fired from the cockpit.
