&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s soon as heroes get theirs hands on a starship,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they want to modify it. The desire for faster hyperdrives, more weapons, better shields, and possibly even some space for smuggled goods generally comes before the first payment to a Hutt loan shark is due. Upgrading and modifying a starship gives players a sense of ownership that makes them more connected to a campaign, and it serves other useful purposes as well.

Heroes who want to improve a starship have a built-in reason to take risks to earn credits (or other re-<br>wards, such as the use of the repair bay of a grateful military group). Although *Star Wars* focuses on on heroic action-adventure over the cobbling together of credits for tinkering with a ship, many characters are simply more motivated if they know there's a material reward on the line. Furthermore, a starship acts as a base of operations, allowing heroes to have a place that seems like home even as they gallivant across the galaxy. Finally, as the heroes gain levels, a better-equipped ship prepares them for greater challenges.

## Modifying a Starship
When ships are produced, they are left with extra space, superstructure, and power production to facilitate the addition of new system modifications and suites. In addition to the costs associated with acquiring raw materials, components, and installation, each modification consumes one of a ship's modifi-cation slots. This section details all of the system mod-ifications available to a ship. There are five categories of modifications, discussed later in this chapter.

When players acquire a new ship, it typically comes with minimal modifications already installed. Players then choose the modifications they want installed on their ship. Like construction and upgrading, installing new systems and modifying old ones takes materials, time, and a substantial workforce. Even with the requisite components, the GM may decide that a modification is inaccessible; it might only be obtainable if the heroes get hold of it directly, by recovering it from a supply depot, trading it off of a collector, or stealing it from the manufacturer. 

The cost of a modification depends on its category, as shown below in the **Modification Category Cost** table.  These costs reflect the material and personnel costs of assembling and installing a modification, and would be directly reflected in the increased cost of a ship bought with these modifications pre-installed. However, if PCs can provide the workforce to install the modification and invest their time, the final costs incurred to add a modification are only half that shown (just the material cost of an assembled modification). Moreover, one or more PCs can assemble a modifi-cation without the ship's presence being required by spending an amount of time assembling based on the material cost of the assembled modification (half the total installed cost) and by using raw materials equal to half the material cost of the installed modification (one-quarter the total installed cost).

For example, a crew could acquire raw materials equal to 1000cr and assemble a Universal modification for a small ship (having a total installed cost of 4000cr). The material cost of the modification would then be 2000cr. Then, the crew could install that modification in a small ship for a final installed cost for the Universal modification of 4000cr. Alternatively, the crew may have found this assembled modification as loot worth 2000cr and could hire a shipyard to install the modifi-cation by paying just the installation portion (2000cr) of the total installed cost (4000cr). Any combination of this process is feasible.

##### Modification Category Base Cost
| Modification Category | Base Cost |
|:----|----:|
| Engineering  | 3,500 cr |
| Operation | 3,500 cr |
| Suite | 5,000 cr |
| Universal | 4,000 cr |
| Weapon | 3,000 cr |

### Size Modifiers
In the same way it costs more to upgrade a capital ship than a starfighter, it costs more to modify it as well. Each starship has a cost modifier depending on the ship's size, as shown in the Starship Size Modification Cost table below:

##### Starship Size Modification Cost
| Starship Size | Cost Modifier |
|:----:|:-------------:|
| Tiny  |x 0.5 |
| Small |x 1 |
| Medium|x 2 |
| Large |x 5 |
| Huge |x 50 |
| Gargantuan |x 500 |

For instance, to purchase and install a Hardpoint in a Small ship, it costs 3,000 credits. To purchase and install one on a Huge ship, however, it costs 150,000 (3,000 x 50).

For a Small ship, two people can do everything necessary (though additional staff will reduce the time taken), while Medium or larger ships require a more extensive workforce, as shown below in the Starship Size Modification Workforce table.

##### Starship Size Modification Workforce
| Starship Size | Minimum Workforce |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | 1 |
| Small  | 2 |
| Medium  | 4 |
| Large  | 10 |
| Huge | 100 |
| Gargantuan | 1,000 |

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Modification Slots
The number of modifications that a ship can easily accommodate is based on the ship's size, as shown below in the Modification Capacity by Ship Size table.

#### Modification Capacity by Ship Size

| Starship Size | Modification Slots |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  |10 |
| Small |20 |
| Medium |30 |
| Large |50 |
| Huge |60 |
| Gargantuan |70 |

However, if you lack sufficient modification slots to support a modification, you can still add it, if you are willing to spend more time and credits for installing all the space and subsystems required to support the modification.  For every modification slot you manually add to your ship, add 50% to the modification category base cost.  Additionally, for every modification you install over your modification capacity, add a cumulative 2 to the installation DC for a tiny to medium ship, and a cumulative 1 to the installation DC for a large to gargantuan ship.

### Modification Time
With sufficient workforce, a snubfighter can be modified in no more than a week's time. However, a new modification layout in a freighter can take up to a month, and an overhaul of a large ship such as a cruiser might take a year. It isn't practical for a smaller workforce to make changes to such big ships, regardless of how much time the workers have.

Because workers generally craft at a rate of 250cr/day, the base time needed to modify a starship is calculated as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**time (in days) = ("modification category base cost" x "starship size modification cost") / (250 x "size of workforce")**

</div>

___

For instance, to install a Hardpoint in a Small ship, with a workforce of two, it takes six days. To install one on a Huge ship, with a workforce of 100, however, it also takes six days.

It is assumed that each member of the workforce works 8 hours per day.

### Modification Grade And Ship Tier
Finally, modifications have a grade (0 if not listed).
High-grade modifications are more costly, using scarce
materials to construct and install. When purchasing
and installing a modification with a listed grade,
multiply the final cost of the modification by the
modification’s grade, if Grade 1 or higher. As an example, a Grade 2 modification would
have two times the final cost of a Grade 0 or 1 modification. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:25px'></div> 

Additionally, these modifications require more precise skill to install, as shown below in the Modification Grade Installation by Ship Tier table. However, ships of higher quality (high tier) make it easier to install these high-quality (high grade) modifications.  

### Modification Installation Check
When making a modification, the foremost mechanic must make an Intelligence (Mechanic’s Kit) check to correctly install modifications. A GM may decide to assume that this check is automatically passed when a party contracts out the instalation of a modification to a shipyard adequately equipped to routinely handle such an installation. The DC for the check varies based on the grade of the modification and the tier of the ship, as shown below in the Modification Grade Installation by Ship Tier table below.

##### Modification Grade Installation by Ship Tier  
|Modification<br> Grade|Tier<br> 0|Tier<br> 1|Tier<br> 2|Tier<br> 3|Tier<br> 4|Tier<br> 5|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|**Grade 0**| 10|  9|  8|  7|  6|  5|
|**Grade 1**| 17| 12| 11| 10|  9|  8| 
|**Grade 2**| 24| 19| 14| 13| 12| 11| 
|**Grade 3**| 31| 26| 21| 16| 15| 14| 
|**Grade 4**| 38| 33| 28| 23| 18| 17| 
|**Grade 5**| 45| 40| 35| 30| 25| 20| 

On a failure, half the requisite time and cost is incurred, but the modification is not installed.

### Prerequisites
Some modifications have prerequisites that must be met before they can be installed. 

If at any time you lose access to a modification's prerequisite, such as removal or ship damage, you can't use that modification again until you regain access to the prerequisite.

### Ability Score Maximums
If a tier feature or modification would increase an ability score above its maximum without also increasing that maximum, you can instead allocate that additional ability score increase to another ability score.

### Changing Saving Throw Proficiency
When a starship is created, a saving throw proficiency may be chosen from a list available to the starship. Later on, however, players may want to change their starship's saving throw proficiency to another of the available options. Changing a saving throw proficiency requires time and credits as if installing a new universal modification.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Removing Modifications
Sometimes, characters might decide they want to remove a modification in favor of a new one. Removing a modification requires half the cost it takes to install the modification originally, and takes half the time.


### Removing Tiers
Sometimes, characters might decide they want to change a selection made for a starship tier feature. To do so, they must remove the tier from the ship, reducing the ship's tier by one. Doing so removes all features from the ship earned at the new tier, including Ability Score Improvements, additional Hull and Shield Dice, and additional modifications.

Removing a starship tier requires half the cost it takes to upgrade to that tier, and takes half the time.

If upgrading the ship to the tier again at the same time as removal, the additional time to remove is incurred, but the cost to remove is not required.

### Starship Tier Features
If a modification is granted to your starship by a starship tier feature, such as the Role Specialization feature, that modification does not require an Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check, comes at no additional cost, does not take a modification slot or count against your ship's maximum suites--unless otherwise stated-- and you can't voluntarily remove it. If your starship already has that modification, you may install an additional modification that is available to you and of equal or lesser grade instead.

### Stock Modifications
Also at tier 0, each ship comes with a number of modifications, at no additional cost, depending on its size, as shown in chapter 3. These modifications do take up modification slots.

## Modification Categories
There are five categories of modification. Each category has separate rules governing its use.

### Engineering Systems
These modifications offer unique functionality to the ship. Each engineering system can be chosen multiple times.

### Operation Systems
These specialized modifications aid in the operation and response of the ship. Each operation system can be chosen only once.

\columnbreak

### Suite Systems
Suite systems add additional functionality to the ship in the form of bays, stations and designated areas, offering increased utility to civilians, crewmembers, and troopers. Each suite system can be chosen no more than ten times. All suite systems require a ship of size Small or larger. In addition to their modification slot cost, ships are limited to the number of suite systems they can have, depending on the ship's size and constitution modifier, as shown below in the Starship Size Maximum Suites table.

##### Starship Size Maximum Suites
| Starship Size | Maximum Suites |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | — |
| Small  | -1 + con. mod. |
| Medium  | 3 + con. mod. |
| Large  | 3 + 2x con. mod. |
| Huge | 6 + 3x con. mod. |
| Gargantuan | 10 + 4x con. mod. |

Additionally, unless otherwise specified, each suite system can accommodate a standard number of civilians, crewmembers, or troopers, as shown below in the **Starship Size Suite Capacity** table.  A ship does not gain a feature that accommodates less than 1.

##### Starship Size Suite Capacity
| Starship Size | Suite Capacity |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | — |
| Small  | 1 |
| Medium  | 4 |
| Large  | 400 |
| Huge | 4,000 |
| Gargantuan | 40,000 |

### Universal Systems
These modifications offer passive benefits to the ship as a whole. Each Universal System can be chosen only once.

### Weapon Systems
These modifications deal with the installation and improvement of weapon systems. Each weapon system can be chosen multiple times.

A ship is proficiently equipped by having the weapon system installed, therefore any crewmember using a system can add their proficiency bonus when the weapon system indicates.

<div style='margin-top:201px'></div>

## Engineering Systems
The systems are presented in alphabetical order. If a system has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the system at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.



### Alternative Fuel Converter
Your ship is equipped with an alternative fuel converter which allows the conversion of materials to a potential fuel source. Over the course of 10 minutes, a crewmember can make a constitution (Regulation) check (DC  = 10 or half the number of days since the ship's last refueling, whichever number is higher). On a success, the ship recovers one unit worth of fuel.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes refitting.

### Automated Protocols
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Damage Control System_<br>

You upgrade your damage control system. A crewmember can take the Patch action as a reaction.  This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes refitting. Additionally, you can add your ship's intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to whenever you roll hull dice to regain hull points.  

Finally, your ship is expertly equipped for Constitution (Patch) checks.

### Boarding Harpoon
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Hardened Prow_<br>

Your ship has been further modified with a massive grappling harpoon, through which creatures can pass. Your ship is expertly equipped for Strength (Ram) checks.

Additionally, when a crewmember takes the Ram action, on a success, the ships become harpooned. While harpooned, your ship and the target ship are slowed as show in the Harpooned and Harpooning Ships Slowed Level tables, below. A crewmember can release the harpooned ship at any time (no action required). The harpooned ship is automatically released if your ship becomes disabled, or if it is forcefully moved more than 100 feet away from your ship.

### Buzz Droid Cloud
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>

As an action, a crewmember may scatter a large number of Buzz Droids across space in a 200-foot radius sphere centered on a point within 1500 feet. These Buzz Droids tear apart the hull of any ship that encounters them. The area becomes difficult terrain for up to a number of minutes equal to you ship's tier. When a ship moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 kinetic damage directly to the hull for every 50 feet it travels.

The Buzz Droids are nearly invisible in the darkness of space. Any creature or ship that can’t see the area at the time the area is created must make a Wisdom (Scan) check (DC 15) to notice the Buzz Droids before entering the area.

The effects of this feature last until the beginning of your next turn unless the crewmember uses a bonus action to maintain it.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.


### Carbonite Launcher, Mk I
_**Modification Grade:** 1_<br>

As an action, a crewmember may cause a wave of cold energy to spread out from your ship. Each ship in a 150-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's wisdom modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 2d6 cold damage and gains a level of slowed until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half as much damage, and suffers no additional effect.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Carbonite Launcher, Mk II
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Carbonite Launcher, Mk I_<br>

As an action, a crewmember may cause an explosion of cold energy to erupt from a point it chooses within 900 feet. Each ship in a 50-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's wisdom modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 3d6 cold damage, and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a ship takes half as much damage and isn’t slowed.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.


### Carbonite Launcher, Mk III
_**Modification Grade:** 3_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Carbonite Launcher, Mk II_<br>

A storm of cryogenic energy encompasses space in a 300-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 1200 feet. Each ship in the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's wisdom modifier). A creature takes 2d8 kinetic damage and 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

&emsp;The storm’s area of effect becomes difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

### Carbonite Launcher, Mk IV
_**Modification Grade:** 4_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Carbonite Launcher, Mk III_<br>

As an action, your ship can create a cloud of icy fog in a 200-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 1200 feet. The sphere extends around objects, and its area is heavily obscured. The fog is semi-solid, and its area is considered difficult terrain. Each ship that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 4d6 cold damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of its turn. The fog lasts for a number of rounds equal to your ship's tier (minimum of one) or until it’s dispersed.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

### Carbonite Launcher, Mk V
_**Modification Grade:** 5_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Carbonite Launcher, Mk IV_<br>

As an action, a crewmember may generate an explosion of cryogenic energy in a 600-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 2500 feet. Each ship in the affected area must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's iwisdom modifier). On a failed save, the ship takes 8d6 + 20 cold damage and is stunned for 1 minute as it is encased in carbonite. On a successful save, the ship takes half damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn.

As an action, a crewmember of a stunned ship can make a Strength check (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's wisdom modifier), ending this effect on itself on a success.

A ship reduced to 0 hull points by this power explodes instantly, as its hull shatters into frozen chunks.

This feature can be used once. All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

### Countermeasures
This modification adds a series of countermeasures to the ship, granting it a more active approach to ward off effects. Once per round, when your ship is forced to make a saving throw against an effect that would cause it to be blinded, ionized, shocked, stalled, stunned, or tractored a crewmember can use their reaction to add the ship's Wisdom modifier to the roll (minimum of +1).

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum


### Damage Control System
You install a damage control system on your ship.  A crewmember can take the Patch action as a bonus action.  This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes refitting.

Additionally, your ship is proficiently equipped for Constitution (Patch) checks.

### Electrical Dischargers

As an action a crewmember may cause your ship to emit a burst of electricity. Each ship within 150 feet, other than you, must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's strength modifier) or take 1d6 lightning damage.

This power’s damage increases by 1d6 for every tier your ship is above first tier: 2nd tier (2d6), 3rd tier (3d6), 4th tier (4d6), and 5th tier (5d6).

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.


### Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk I
_**Modification Grade:** 1_<br>

As an action, a crewmember can cause a ship you can see within 300 feet to become shrouded with electronic interference and holographic illusions. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier), or it takes 1d6 lightning damage and moves 50 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 50 feet. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. If the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn’t move.

This power’s damage increases by 1d6 for every tier your ship is above first tier: 2nd tier (2d6), 3rd tier (3d6), 4th tier (4d6), and 5th tier (5d6).

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk II
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk I_<br>

As an action, a crewmember may choose up to three ships that you can see within 300 feet to make Wisdom saving throws (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier). The first time each turn a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw for up to a minute until the ability ends, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

The effects of this feature last until the beginning of your next turn unless the crewmember uses a bonus action to maintain it.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

\columnbreak

### Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk III
_**Modification Grade:** 3_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk II_<br>

As an action, a crewmember may choose one ship you can see within 1200 feet and scramble its ability to differentiate targets. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier). If the ship is directly piloted by a humanoid that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to that crewmember’s Intelligence modifier. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all ships it can see as enemies for up to one minute until the power ends. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Whenever the affected ship chooses another target, it must choose the target at random from among the ships it can see within range of the attack, power, or other ability it’s using. 

The effects of this feature last until the beginning of your next turn unless the crewmember uses a bonus action to maintain it.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk IV
_**Modification Grade:** 4_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk III_<br>

As an action, a crewmember may scramble the targeting protocols of nearby ships. Each ship in a 300-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 1200 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier).  If the ship is directly piloted by a humanoid that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to that crewmember’s Intelligence modifier. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies up to a minute, until the ability ends. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.  

Whenever the affected ship chooses another target, it must choose the target at random from among the ships it can see within range of the attack, power, or other ability it's using. 

The effects of this feature last until the beginning of your next turn unless the crewmember uses a bonus action to maintain it.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk V
_**Modification Grade:** 5_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk IV_<br>

You emit an electromagnetic pulse, potentially shutting down all ships besides your own within 1200 feet. Ships within range must succeed on a Wisdom (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier) or become disabled up to a minute or until the power ends. 

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

&emsp;Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the power. If the saving throw succeeds, the power ends.

The effects of this feature last until the beginning of your next turn unless the crewmember uses a bonus action to maintain it.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Emergency Generator
Your ship is equipped with an emergency generator to recharge shields. When your ship is reduced to 0 shield points but not destroyed outright, a crewmember can use their reaction to have it drop to 1 shield point instead. Alternatively, if the ship has 0 shield points, a crewmember can use their action to restore shield points equal to twice the ship's strength modifier. 

Once either feature has been used, the emergency generator can't be used again until the ship recharges.

### Feedback Shield
Your ship's shield is enhanced to reflect damage to would-be attackers. As a reaction to the ship being hit with a primary or secondary weapon, a crewmember can use their reaction to deal damage to the attacking ship. The damage depends on your ship's size: 1d4 for a Tiny ship, 1d6 for a Small ship, 1d8 for a Medium ship, 1d10 for a Large ship, 1d12 for a Huge ship, or 1d20 for a Gargantuan ship. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

### Flare Pods
Your ship is equipped with a series of counter-measure flares. When your ship is forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, a crewmember can use their reaction to release a flare. When they do so, your ship has advantage on the triggering saving throw. The crewmember can choose to use this feature after the roll is made, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. If they already have advantage on the saving throw, they can instead reroll one of the dice once.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes refitting.

### Gravitic Polarization Beam
_**Modification Grade:** 4_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Gravity Well Projector_<br>

As an action, a crewmember can use a ship's gravity well projector to target a ship within 600 feet and within that projector's limited arc. The beam disrupts matter on an atomic level, causing it to rip apart. The target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + ship tier + the ship’s Strength modifier). The target takes 8d8 true damage on a failed save, or half<br> as much damage on a successful one.

This feature can be used a number of<br> times equal to your ship's tier (a<br> minimum of once). All expended uses<br> are regained when the ship recharges.

\columnbreak


### Gravity Slice
_**Modification Grade:** 3_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Gravity Well Projector in each limited arc_<br>

As an action, a crewmember can release a circular gravitic burst. Each ship within 200 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + ship tier + the ship’s Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 8d6 true damage and, if the ship is the same size or smaller, is pushed back 50 feet. On a successful save, a ship takes half damage and isn’t pushed.

All objects one size category smaller than the ship or smaller are also pushed 50 feet back.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Gravity Well Projector
_**Prerequisite:** Ship size Large or larger_<br>

Your ship is modified with a gravity well projector that prevents ships from jumping to hyperspace, and even pulls ships from hyperspace, through use of an interdiction field. 

A crewmember can activate the gravity well projector as an action, which has a range of 1,000 feet and a limited firing arc, as described in Chapter 9. For up to a minute, while active, this ship and ships of the same size or smaller that enter or start their turn within the gravity well projector's firing arc can't activate their hyperdrives.

The effects of this feature last until the beginning of your next turn unless the crewmember uses a bonus action to maintain it.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Hardened Prow
Your ship has been modified to to be more effective at ramming. When a crewmember takes the Ram action, and the target fails the contested check, the damage dealt is increased by an amount equal to two of your ship's Hull Dice. 

Additionally, your ship is proficiently equipped for Strength (Ram) checks.

### Hyperspace pulsemass generator
_**Modification Grade:** 4_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Ship size Large or larger_<br>

As an action, a crewmember can create a turbulent field of tiny spheres of hyper-energy that buffets ships around you. The field extends out to a distance of 150 feet around your ship for a number of rounds up to your ship's tier (minimum of one).

When you activate this feature, you can designate any number of ships you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected ship gains 1 slowed level while in the area, and when the ship enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + ship tier + the ship’s Strength modifier). On a failed save, the ship takes 3d8 energy damage. On a successful save, the ship takes half as much damage.

The effects of this feature last until the beginning of your next turn unless the crewmember uses a bonus action to maintain it.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Improved Countermeasures
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Countermeasures_<br>

This modification enhances your ship's countermeasures, allowing it to quickly clear lingering effects. As an action, a crewmember can activate this feature, ending the blinded, ionized, shocked, stalled, stunned, and tractored conditions.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes refitting.

Additionally, your ship can now add half its Wisdom modifier (rounded down) to its Dexterity saving throws.

### Inertial Dampeners
This system lessens the transfer of external impacts into the ship's interior.  When you are forced to make a Concentration check due to damage, impacts, or explosions exterior to the ship, you have advantage.

Additionally, when you take the Evade action, skill checks and attack rolls made by your ship or anyone on it do not suffer from disadvantage from the evasion.  Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges. 

### Interdiction Drive
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>

You install an interdiction drive on your ship, which can be activated to impede ships around it. 

As an action, a crewmember can engage the interdiction drive. Each ship within 300 feet of your ship must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + the crewmembers's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship gains 1 level of slowed until the end of your ship's next turn.


\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

&emsp;If a ship is two or more sizes larger than your ship, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it is two or more sizes smaller, it instead has disadvantage. 

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Invulnerability Drive
_**Modification Grade:** 3_<br>

Your ship is equipped with an experimental device which can render it immune to all damage. As an action, a crewmember can activate the drive. Once activated, the drive lasts for 1d4 rounds, granting the following benefits:

- Your ship is immune to all damage.
- Your ship's flying speed is reduced by half.
- Your ship's turning speed is doubled.

A crewmember can end this effect at any time, no action required. When the effect ends, the crewmember must make a Destruction saving throw. On a failure, the ship suffers 1 level of system damage.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes refitting.

### Junk Disposal

As an action, a crewmember may jettison a clump of refuse or junk that expands into a 50-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 100 feet.  Each ship in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + the crewmembers's proficiency bonus + the ship's Constitution modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 1d6 kinetic damage and is shocked until the end of it's next turn. 

The junk field's area of effect becomes difficult terrain for one minute or until cleared.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship’s tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### MINING LASER
Your ship is equipped with a laser used to extract ores and other minerals from objects such as asteroids.  Checks made while using the mining laser for determining outcomes of work (for example, using downtime rules from Wretched Hives) are made with advantage. If you already have advantage on the roll, you can instead reroll one of the dice once.

Additionally, a crewmember can activate the mining laser as an action in order to make a Strength (Boost) check against a ship that is touching you (for example, a ship that is ramming or being rammed by your ship, or one you are landed on) (DC = the ship's AC).  On a success, the adjacent ship takes 1d8 + Strength modifier energy damage.

### Nano-Droid Distributor
Your ship is equipped with a nano-droid distributor that allows it to repair other ships. When a crewmember takes the Patch action, they can instead repair another ship within 100 feet. You spend and roll one of your ship's Hull Dice, and the target ship regains that many hull points.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Power Backup
Your ship is equipped with a back up battery, which can give it renewed energy. When your ship is reduced to 0 hull points but not destroyed outright, a crewmember can use their reaction to have it drop to 1 hull point instead. Alternatively, if the ship is making Destruction saving throws, a crewmember can use their action to have the ship automatically succeed on a Destruction saving throw.

Once either feature has been used, the power backup can't be used again until the ship recharges.

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Power Harpoon
As an action, a crewmember may make a ship weapon attack with the power harpoon.  The harpoon's range is 400/1600 ft.  On a hit, the target is harpooned, connecting your ship to the target by a 1,600 foot cable. 

At any time as a free action, if the connected objects are closer than 1600 feet, a crewmember on your ship can choose whether the cable is slack or taught. When the cable is taught, any movement by one object away from the other, tows the other object.  When the cable is taught, movement by the first object away from the other object is considered movement through difficult terrain if the first object is within one size category of the other object.  An object two or more size categories smaller than the other object cannot move away from the other object when the cable is taught.

If the objects are 1600 feet apart, the cable is always taught.

While connected by the cable, a crewmember can use a bonus action to reel, pulling your ship towards the target (if larger than your ship), or the target to-wards your ship (if the same size or smaller than your ship) by 200 feet. At any time, a crewmember on your ship can release the cable (no action required).

As an action, a crewmember of a harpooned ship can attempt to remove the harpoon. To do so, the ship must succeed on a Strength (Boost) check contested by your Strength (Boost) or Dexterity (Maneuvering) check.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Pressor Beam Generator
_**Modification Grade:** 1_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Ship size Large or larger, Tractor Beam_<br>

As an action, a crewmember can choose one ship or object within 600 feet that is two or more size categories smaller than your ship and in an arc of a tractor beam of the ship. The ship or object is pushed 600 feet in a direction of your choice. If the ship or object collides with any one target during its travel, both the ship or object and the target take 3d8 kinetic damage. If the target is a ship, it must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + ship tier + the ship’s Strength modifier). On a failed save, it takes 3d8 kinetic damage, or half as much on a successful one.

This feature shares uses with the ship's Tractor Beam, and grants an additional such use.

\columnbreak

### Pressor Field Generator
_**Modification Grade:** 1_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Ship size Large or larger, Tractor Beam_<br>

As an action, a crewmember can unleash a burst of energy from a selected tractor beam of the ship. Each ship in the tractor beam arc and within 150 feet must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + ship tier + the ship’s Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 3d6 kinetic damage and, if it is one size category larger than your ship or smaller, is also pushed back 50 feet. On a successful save, a ship takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed. All objects your ship's size category or smaller within the area of effect are also pushed 50 feet.

This feature shares uses with the ship's Tractor Beam, and grants an additional such use.


### Pressor Lensing
_**Modification Grade:** 3_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Pressor Beam Generator_<br>

As an action, a crewmember can choose a ship within 600 feet within an arc of a tractor beam of the ship. The target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + ship tier + the ship’s Strength modifier). On a failed save the target takes 5d8 kinetic damage and is tractored until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and is not tractored.

The same crewmember can use a bonus action while the target is tractored to move the target up to 50 feet in any direction.

This feature shares uses with the ship's Tractor Beam, and grants an additional such use.

### Repulsor Ray
_**Modification Grade:** 5_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Pressor Lensing_<br>

As an action, a crewmember can unleash a beam of focused energy from a tractor beam of the ship in a 50-foot-wide, 600-foot-long line. Each ship in the line must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + ship tier + the ship’s Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 8d6 kinetic damage and is shocked until the beginning of their next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t shocked.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Self-Destruct Mechanism
Your ship is equipped with a self-destruct mechanism that can cause immense destruction at the expense of the ship. A crewmember can activate the self-destruct mechanism as an action, setting a timer up to 10 minutes in length. When the timer expires, the ship explodes, dealing fire damage to each enemy within range. The damage is calculated as follows; for each Hull Die the ship has, roll it and add the ship's Strength modifier to the roll. 


The range that the self-destruct mechanism impacts varies, depending on the ship's size:

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

- **Tiny**: A Tiny ship deals damage to each ship within 50 feet of it.
- **Small**: A Small ship deals damage to each ship within 100 feet of it.
- **Medium**: A Medium ship deals damage to each ship within 200 feet of it.
- **Large**: A Large ship deals damage to each ship within 400 feet of it.
- **Huge**: A Huge ship deals damage to each ship within 1,000 feet of it.
- **Gargantuan**: A Gargantuan ship deals damage to each ship within 2,000 feet of it.




### Shield Bleedthrough
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>

Your ship's reactor is overhauled to give temporary boosts to your ship's weapon batteries. When your ship hits another ship with a primary or secondary weapon attack while it still has shield points, a crewmember can use their reaction to cause some of the damage to bleed through. The damage the ship's shields take is reduced by an amount equal to your ship's Strength modifier. The ship's hull then takes this much damage. This damage is of the same type as the weapon's damage.

### Ship Slicer, Mk I
_**Modification Grade:** 1_<br>

As an action, a crewmember may choose a Small or smaller ship you can see within 1200 feet. The target must make an Intelligence (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier) saving throw. On a failed save, it is disabled until the start of your next turn. Each time the ship takes damage or is the target of a hostile power or ability while disabled in this way, it can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.


### Ship Slicer, Mk II
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Ship Slicer, Mk I_<br>

As an action, a crewmember may upload a computer virus that stalls a ship within 900 feet. Roll 7d6; if the ship’s remaining hull points are less than the total, the ship is stalled for one minute or until the ship takes damage.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

\columnbreak


### Ship Slicer, Mk III
_**Modification Grade:** 3_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Ship Slicer, Mk II_<br>

As an action, a crewmember can dictate a one-word command to a ship you can see within 600 feet. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier) or follow the command on its next turn. If the ship is directly piloted by a humanoid that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to that crewmember’s Intelligence modifier. Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can’t follow your command, the ability ends.


**Approach.** The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

**Deactivate.** The target becomes disabled and then ends its turn.

**Flee.** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.

**Halt.** The target doesn’t move and takes no actions. 

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Ship Slicer, Mk IV
_**Modification Grade:** 4_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Ship Slicer, Mk III_<br>

As an action, a crewmember may cause a ship that you can see within 600 feet to succeed on an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier) or be disabled for up to a minute, until the feature ends. At the beginning of each of its turns, the ship can make another Intelligence saving throw. On a success, the feature ends.

The effects of this feature last until the beginning of your next turn unless the crewmember uses a bonus action to maintain it.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Ship Slicer, Mk V
_**Modification Grade:** 5_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Ship Slicer, Mk IV_<br>

As an action, a crewmember can choose one ship you can see within 600 feet and attempt to remotely override its controls. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier). If the ship is directly piloted by a humanoid that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to that crewmember’s Intelligence modifier. If you or ships that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the ship is charmed by you for the duration.

While the ship is charmed, you have a wireless link with it as long as the two of you are within the same system. Via your ship, you can use this link to issue commands to the ship while you are conscious (using a bonus action), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that ship,” “Move over there,” or “Fly casual.” If the ship completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the ship takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the ship to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.  For every action, bonus action, or reaction you make the ship use, you must spend an equivalent action.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Intelligence saving throw against the power. If the saving throw succeeds, the power ends.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.


### Shock Absorbers
_**Prerequisite:** Ship size Medium or larger_<br>

Your ship has been modified to withstand sudden impacts, and to be more effective at ramming. Your ship has resistance to kinetic damage caused by ramming.

### Shocking Harpoon
_**Modification Grade:** 4_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Boarding Harpoon_<br>

Your ship's harpoon has been modified, allowing it to conduct bursts of energy into the harpooned ship. A harpooned ship has disadvantage on the contested Strength (Boost) check to remove the harpoon. Additionally, as an action on each of their turns, a crewmember can deal lightning damage to a harpooned ship. The damage is equal to one of your ship's Shield Dice + your ship's Strength modifier.

Finally, when your ship makes a Strength (Ram) check, it can reroll one of the dice.

\columnbreak

### SLAM
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>

Your ship gains a SubLight Acceleration Motor (SLAM).
As an action, a crewmember can activate the SLAM to cause the ship to immediately move forward an amount up to the ship's movement speed.  This movement must be made in a straight line and the ship's heading cannot change during this movement.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once) but no more than once per ship's turn. All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges. 


### SLAM, Advanced
_**Modification Grade:** 3_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** SLAM_<br>

Your ship's SubLight Acceleration Motor (SLAM) has been enhanced, granting more utility.  When a crewmember takes the Fly action, the increase now equals twice your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 300 feet, for example, your ship can move up to 900 feet on its turn if you Fly. Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional Movement by the same amount. If your ship's speed of 300 feet is reduced to 150 feet, for instance, your ship can move up to 450 feet this turn if you Fly.

This action still affects your entire ship: any skill check or attack roll made by your ship or anyone on it has disadvantage.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.


### Super-Heavy Ion Cannon
_**Prerequisite:** Ship size Medium or larger_<br>

Your ship is equipped with a weapon designed to disable enemy ships without damaging them through use of a specialized ion cannon that delivers a powerful electromagnetic burst. A crewmember can fire the super-heavy ion cannon at a target as an action, which has a range of 1,000 feet and a limited firing arc, as described in Chapter 9. The target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + the crewmember’s proficiency bonus + the ship’s Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship is stunned for 1 minute. As an action on each of the ship’s turns, a crewmember can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

If a ship is targeted by a ship two or more sizes larger than them, it has disadvantage on the initial saving throw. If targeted by a ship two or more sizes smaller, it instead has advantage.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship’s tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges. If you have more than one Super-Heavy Ion Cannon installed, they all share this amount of uses, and each Super-Heavy Ion Cannon past the first grants an additional use.

### Tibanna Gas Projector, Mk I
_**Modification Grade:** 1_<br>

As an action, a crewmember can dump a load of tibanna gas in a 100-foot cube within 600 feet. For up to a number of rounds equal to your ship's tier, it is difficult terrain and lightly obscures the area.

When the gas appears, each ship in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's constitution modifier) or become ionized. A ship that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw.

The gas is flammable. Any 50 foot cube of the gas exposed to fire burns away in one round. Each ship that enters the fire or starts it turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Tibanna Gas Projector, Mk II
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Tibanna Gas Projector, Mk I_<br>

As an action, a crewmember can shoot a thin sheet of flames from the ship. Each ship in a 150-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's constitution modifier). A ship takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Tibanna Gas Projector, Mk III
_**Modification Grade:** 3_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Tibanna Gas Projector, Mk II_<br>

As an action, a crewmember can expel a burst of flame in a line 300 feet long and 50 feet wide, originating from your ship. Each ship in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's constitution modifier). A ship takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.


### Tibanna Gas Projector, Mk IV
_**Modification Grade:** 4_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Tibanna Gas Projector, Mk III_<br>

As an action, a crewmember can create a wall of fire within 1200 feet. You can make the wall up to 300 feet on a side and 10 feet thick, or a spherical shell up to 150 feet in diameter, and 10 feet thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for up to a number of rounds equal to your ship's tier.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

&emsp;Each ship that enters the fire or starts it turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's constitution modifier). On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area.

The effects of this feature last until the beginning of your next turn unless the crewmember uses a bonus action to maintain it.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Tibanna Gas Projector, Mk V
_**Modification Grade:** 5_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Tibanna Gas Projector, Mk IV_<br>

As an action, a crewmember can launch tibanna gas canisters, creating a firestorm in a location they choose within 1500 feet. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 100-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each ship in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's constitution modifier). It takes 7d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A ship in the area of more than one cube is affected only once.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Tractor Beam
This modification adds a tractor beam to a ship, which can be used to grasp and guide vessels and debris.

As an action, a crewmember can activate the tractor beam, which has a range of 600 feet and a limited firing arc, as described in Chapter 9. Each ship or object of your size or smaller within the firing arc must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + ship tier + the ship’s Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship is tractored. An object automatically fails this saving throw. 

As a bonus action, a crewmember can move a tractored ship or object in any direction.  A ship or object two or more sizes smaller than you can be moved up to 200 feet, a ship or object one size category smaller than you can be moved up to 100 feet, and a ship or object your size can be moved up to 50 feet. If at the end of this movement the ship or object strikes another ship or object, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. An object automatically fails this saving throw. On a failed save, they both take 1d4 kinetic damage. 

As an action, a crewmember at the helm of the tractored ship can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

The saving throws are made with disadvantage if the ship is smaller than you.

If you attempt to tractor a ship or object larger than you, you can choose to gain the tractored condition and move yourself.

You can end the tractor beam at any time (no action required).

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

&emsp;This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship’s tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges. If you have more than one Tractor Beam installed, they all share this amount of uses, and each Tractor Beam past the first grants an additional use.

### Tractor Beam Heavy Capacitors
_**Modification Grade:** 2_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Tractor Beam_<br>

As an action, a crewmember can use a ship's tractor beam to move a ship or object one size category larger than the ship or smaller within 900 feet and within the tractor beam's arc. The target must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + ship tier + the ship’s Strength modifier). An object automatically fails this saving throw. On a failed save, the ship or object moves a number of feet in a direction of your choice based on its size. A ship or object two or more size categories smaller than your ship can be moved up to 900 feet, a ship or object one size category smaller can be moved up to 600 feet, a ship or object of the same size category can be moved up to 300 feet, and a ship or object one size category larger can be moved up to 100 feet. If at the end of this movement the ship or object strikes another ship or object, they both take 2d8 kinetic damage.
