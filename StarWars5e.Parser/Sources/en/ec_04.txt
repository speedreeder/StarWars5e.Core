## Addict
You hammer down your fifth bottle of the night, do your last bit of snuff, and bid farewell to the seedy cantina barman. You stagger onto the streets and find a nearby alley in which you empty the night's contents. To many, the next morning's hangovers would be hell. To you, they're a ritual.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Performance, Persuasion, and Sleight of Hand
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Your choice of any gaming set, brewer's kit, or spicer's kit
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A chance cube set, a sabaac deck, 2 days field rations, a flask or belt pouch containing your addiction, a set of common clothes, a bedroll, and a belt pouch containing 25 cr

#### Pick Your Poison
While most addicts are willing to try everything once, they typically have a drug of choice. You can determine what the source of your addiction or determine it randomly below.

### Feature: Addicted
You've been abusing substances for a long time. You always know who to talk to and where to find substances, and you can often identify them in their raw form.

</div>

#### Suggested Characteristics
Addicts can be rude and uncouth, wearing their addiction visibly, or they might hide that addiction and appear to function normally. Importantly, and varying with every addict, why are you addicted? To forget the past? To drown your sorrows? Or are you simply chasing the dragon?

## Amnesiac

</div>

One day you awoke, perhaps in a forest or on a sandy beach, with no recollection of what happened to you. How did you get here? Who were you? These questions elude and boggle your mind. Some people wish for a fresh start, but you never even got a choice.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Insight, Investigation, and Survival 
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Choose one from disguise kit, forgery kit, or tinker's implements
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of common clothes, a relic of your past which you do not remember, and a belt pouch containing 200 cr

> #### Variant: Randomized Proficiencies
> Rather than taking the proficiencies provided by this background, you can choose to take no proficiencies, instead waiting to gain a proficiency during a story moment. When you do so, you must succeed on a DC 15 check. You add your proficiency bonus to this check, but no additional modifiers. On a success, you gain the chosen skill, tool, or language proficiency. On a failure, you do not gain a proficiency, and you can't attempt again for 24 hours. You can gain no more than two skill proficiencies and two tool or language proficiencies in this way.

### Feature: A Life Once Lived
You once had a home, a family, relationships, possessions, but now you are left with nothing but the ability to start anew. You are unfamiliar with the world around you as well as the people in it. You may often need to ask for clarification on things other adventurers may know intrinsically. Some events, locations, names, phrases, or objects may also trigger you to recall small details which could relate to the life you once had, at the discretion of the GM.

### Background Feat

## Archaeologist

</div>

An archaeologist learns about the long-lost and fallen cultures of the past by studying their remains – their bones, their ruins, their surviving masterworks, and their tombs. Those who practice archaeology travel to the far corners of the world to root through crumbled cities and lost dungeons, digging in search of artifacts that might tell the stories of monarchs and high priests, wars and cataclysms.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Investigation, Lore, Perception, or Survival
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Surveyor's implements or scavenging kit
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A case containing a physical or digital map to a ruin or dungeon, a lantern, a vibropick, a set of traveler's clothes, a shovel, a two-person tent, a trinket recovered from a dig site, and a pouch containing 250 cr

#### Dust Digger
Prior to becoming an adventurer, you spent most of your young life crawling around in the dust, pilfering relics of questionable value from crypts and ruins. Though you managed to sell a few of your discoveries and earn enough credits to buy proper adventuring gear, you have held onto an item that has great emotional value to you. You can determine your signature item or determine it randomly below.

<div style='column-count:2'>

|d8|Signature Item|
|:---:|:----------:|
|1|10-foot pole|	
|2|Hat|
|3|Hammer|	
|4|Lantern|

|d8|Signature Item|
|:---:|:----------:|
|5|Medallion|
|6|Prybar|
|7|Shovel|
|8|Whip|

</div>

### Feature: Historical Knowledge
When you enter a ruin or dungeon, you can correctly ascertain its original purpose and determine its builders, whether those were jedi, sith, hutts, rakata, or some other known species or civilization. Additionally, you can readily determine the value of ancient art.

### Background Feat
As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:

<div style='column-count:2'>

|d8|Feat|
|:--:|:--:|
|1|Investigator|
|2|Loremaster|
|3|Perceptive|
|4|Survivalist|

|d8|Feat|
|:--:|:--:|
|5|Crafter|
|6|Specialist|
|7|Linguist|
|8|Dungeon Delver|

</div>

#### Suggested Characteristics
Few archaeologists can resist the lure of an unexplored ruin or dungeon, particularly if such a site is the source of legends or is rumored to contain noteworthy relics. Whatever their motivations, they combine the likes of a dutiful historian with those of a dogged scoundrel.

|4|I have no qualms about stealing from the dead.|

|6|Traps don't make me nervous. Idiots who trigger traps make me nervous.|

|8|You might think I'm a scholar, but I love a good brawl. These fists were made for punching.|

|d6|Ideal|
|:---:|:---------|

## Barbarian
Though you might have only recently arrived in civilized lands, you are no stranger to the values of cooperation and group effort when striving for supremacy. You learned these principles, and much more, as a member of your tribe.

Your people have always tried to hold to the old ways. Tradition and taboo have kept your tribe strong while the kingdoms of others have collapsed into chaos and ruin. But for the last few generations, some bands among the tribes were tempted to settle, make peace, trade, and even to build towns. Perhaps this is why your tribe chose to raise up the totems among the people as living embodiments of his power. Perhaps they needed a reminder of who they were and from whence they came. The Chosen of your tribe led bands back to the old ways, and most of your people abandoned the soft ways of civilization.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Nature, and Survival
- **Tool Proficiencies**: One type of musical instrument or artisan's implements
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A hunting trap, a totemic token or set of tattoos marking your loyalty to your tribe, a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 100 cr

### Feature: Barbarian Heritage
You have an excellent knowledge of not only your tribe's territory, but also the terrain and natural resources of the rest of the worlds. You are familiar enough with any wilderness area that you find twice as much food and water as you normally would when you forage there.

Additionally, you can call upon the hospitality of other tribes in times of need.

### Background Feat
As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:

<div style='column-count:2'>

|d8|Feat|
|:--:|:--:|

|2|Brawny|
|3|Naturalist|
|4|Survivalist|

|d8|Feat|
|:--:|:--:|
|5|Entertainer|
|6|Crafter|
|7|Athlete|
|8|Weapon Expert|

</div>

#### Suggested Characteristics
Often considered rude and uncouth among civilized folk, barbarians have little respect for the niceties of life in the cities. The ties of tribe, clan, family, and the natural world of which they are a part are the most important bonds to most outlanders. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

|d8|Personality Trait|
|:---:|:----------|
|1|I'm driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home.|

|6|I'm always picking things up, absently fiddling with them, and sometimes accidentally breaking them.|
|7|I feel far more comfortable around animals than people.|
|8|I was, in fact, raised by wampas.|

|d6|Ideal|
|:---:|:----------|
|1|**Change.** Life is like the seasons, in constant change, and we must change with it. (Chaotic)|

|5|**Nature.** The natural world is more important than all the constructs of civilization. (Neutral)|
|6|**Glory.** I must earn glory in battle, for myself and my clan. (Any)|

|d6|Bond|
|:---:|:----------|
|1|My family, clan, or tribe is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me.|
|2|An injury to the unspoiled wilderness of my home is an injury to me.|
|3|I will bring terrible wrath down on the Darkdoers who destroyed my homeland.|
|4|I am the last of my tribe, and it is up to me to ensure their names enter legend.|
|5|I suffer awful visions of a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it.|
|6|It is my duty to provide children to sustain my tribe.|

|d6|Flaw|
|:---:|:----------|
|1|I am too enamored of ale, wine, and other intoxicants.|
|2|There's no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest.|
|3|I remember every insult I've received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who's ever wronged me.|
|4|I am slow to trust members of other species, tribes, and societies.|
|5|Violence is my answer to almost any challenge.|
|6|Don't expect me to save those who can't save themselves. It is nature's way that the strong thrive and the weak perish.|

## Bartender

</div>

Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name and they're always glad you came. As a bartender, you're a charismatic fellow that knows how to deal with people. Whether you're the life of the party or simply an ear for someone who needs advice, people from all walks of life are drawn to your trustworthy nature.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, or Persuasion
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Brewer's kit
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of common clothes, a brewer's kit, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

### Feature: Social Lubricant
You have no trouble finding and getting into places that serve drinks. While drinking in a social establishment, strangers take a liking to you and feel comfortable enough to share gossip.

|8|Snappy Interjection|

#### Suggested Characteristics
A bartender's demeanor ranges from jovial to downright rude. Regardless, all bartenders know how to take care of business–they break up fights, kick out drunk patrons, and offer honest counsel to people down on their luck.

## Blackguard 

</div>

You are a member of the Blackguard: a reclusive sect of Force users from the planet of Mustafar. Rather than being determined by the Force, the Blackguard believe that the light or dark dwell within the user, and that to truly increase one's knowledge and strength in the Force, one must understand and seek out the philosophies and abilities of other Force traditions around the galaxy.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Insight, Investigation, Lore, and Survival
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Artificer's implements
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A copy of a Force-wielder organization's text, a trinket from your travels around the galaxy, a set of common clothes including a robe, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

### Feature: Student of the Force
You often know where to find information on Force-sensitive organizations, or where to find someone who would know, and can readily decipher more common lore about them. Your GM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, that it simply cannot be found, or is too difficult to decipher.

### Background Feat

## Bodyguard

</div>

You are a licensed bodyguard, standing by your charge ready to protect them from any threat.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Investigation, and Perception 
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Your choice of demolitions kit, disguise kit, or security kit
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of clandestine clothes, the kit for your chosen tool proficiency, a traumakit, and a belt pouch containing 75 cr

### Feature: Authorized Violence
As a licensed professional, most law enforcement tend to turn a blind eye when you are involved in altercations. You are rarely detained due to wearing armor and wielding weaponry; in fact, while accompanying your client, it is typically socially acceptable for you to go both armed and armored.

### Background Feat
As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:

<div style='column-count:2'>

|5|Specialist|
|6|Linguist|
|7|Athlete|
|8|Durable|

</div>

#### Suggested Characteristics
There are many reasons as to why you may be guarding someone. It could be that you and your family are in the service of a powerful individual, or that you owe a friend a life debt after they rescued you from some perilous encounter. You may be friends with the ones you protect: You may not. But in any case, your loyalties are unwavering, and your courage speaks for itself.

| d8  | Personality Trait |
|:---|:-----------|
|  1  | I am overly cautious of all food and drink that either my client or I consume. |
|  2  | I find it hard to leave my client to themselves. |
|  3  | I try to take the safest routes through cities, roads, or passes: I am not a fan of dark alley shortcuts. |
|  4  | If my client's legs were weary in a dangerous area, I would carry them every step of the way. |
|  5  | Even though I am constantly by my client's side, I cannot help but feel alone sometimes. |
|  6  |	I often try to make situations sound better than they are to make my client feel more comfortable. |
|  7  | I may be a stick in the mud while I am sober, but I am wilder than a rancor when I am intoxicated. |
|  8  | I form attachments to those I care about, and often find myself going above and beyond to make them happy. |

| d6  | Ideal |

|  4  | I have other friends in this business who don't perform their duties exactly how I do. |
|  5  | While that time is behind me now, the faces from my past still linger. |
|  6  | My client isn't the only one who I should protect. There are many more out there without protection. |

| d6  | Flaw |
|:---|:-----------|
|  1  | I have lost clients before. I now find myself detached to prevent future heartache. |
|  2  | I am often times forgetful, much to my client's dismay. |
|  3  | I am very stubborn. It is very nearly impossible to sway my opinions on how things should be handled. |
|  4  | Trust is a rare commodity in my line of work. As such, it is not something I often give to others.|
|  5  | My client and I don't get along in the slightest. It makes it quite difficult to want to look after them. |
|  6  | Although I am sworn to protect my client, I will abandon them in the face of certain death. |

## City Watch
You have served the community where you grew up, standing as its first line of defense against crime and wildlife. You aren't a soldier, directing your gaze outward at possible enemies. Instead, your service to your hometown was to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe.

Even if you're not city-born or city-bred, this background can describe your early years as a member of law enforcement. Most settlements of any size have their own law enforcement forces.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Investigation, and Perception
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A uniform in the style of your unit and indicative of your rank, a horn with which to summon help, a set of binders, and a pouch containing 100 cr

### Feature: Watcher's Eye
Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals. You can easily find the local outpost of the watch or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter.

### Background Feat
As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:

### Feature: A Life Not Lived
Being a clone, you were born from the existence of another. Flashes of deeds you never did, of people you have never met and of information you have never learned sporadically appear. You may be confused with your DNA-Donor by others, being befriended by, or made enemies of, people you have never before met. The exact nature of these revelations depends on the nature of your DNA-Donor; they might lead to a site that only one other has ever seen, some long-forgotten fact, relic or weapon from the past that could reshape the present, or even information that would be damaging to the people who created you.

## Courtier
In your earlier days, you were a personage of some significance in a noble court or a bureaucratic organization. You might or might not come from an upper-class family; your talents, rather than the circumstances of your birth, could have secured you this position.

You might have been one of the many functionaries, attendants, and other hangers-on in Coruscant's upper echelons, or perhaps you traveled in Nar Shaddaa's baroque and sometimes cutthroat conglomeration of factions, nobles, adventurers, and secret societies. You might have been one of the behind-the-scenes law-keepers or functionaries on Dromund Kaas, or you might have grown up on some other affluent planet.

Even if you are no longer a full-fledged member of the group that gave you your start in life, your relationships with your former fellows can be an advantage for you and your adventuring comrades. You might undertake missions with your new companions that further the interest of the organization that gave you your start in life. In any event, the abilities that you honed while serving as a courtier will stand you in good stead as an adventurer.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Insight, Performance, and Survival
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of fine clothes and a pouch containing 150 cr

### Feature: Court Functionality

## Crime Lord
Few societies manage to eradicate crime altogether. In the underworld, someone always rises to the top, either through vision, organisation, or sheer intimidation. The life of a crime lord isn't for the timid. After conquering an unseen empire, the crime lord wages a daily struggle not only to stay on top, but also to stay alive.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Insight, Intimidation, and Persuasion
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set
- **Languages:** One of your choice

#### Criminal Motivation
Not every crime lord is bent on corrupting society and making a profit. Some use their criminal connections to wage guerilla wars against tyrants and despots. Indeed, some historical heroes began as smugglers or pirates, rising through the ranks of their organization to provide a more noble direction for their group's activities. Although some did so to remove an obstacle to making more money, others recognized that ridding the galaxy of evil is a more important long-term goal. Choose the motivation behind your criminal enterprise, or roll on the table below.

Crime lords might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. Unlike common thieves, some crime lords even have some respect for law and authority, with whom they play a cat-and-mouse type game.

## Ex-Cultist

</div>

Once you served alongside your fellow neophytes. You worshiped at altars to a deific entity, performed the sacraments and adorned yourself in the proper fashion.

#### Change of Heart
Why did you walk away from the world you knew? Was this a choice you made, or did fate separate you from your fellow devotees? Do you wish to undo the evil that your cult perpetuated, or would you rejoin your cult if given the chance? 

<div>

|d4|Change of Heart|
|:---:|:----------:|
|1|I witnessed a particularly gruesome rite and ran for my life.|
|2|I asked the wrong kind of questions. The others planned to sacrifice me to our dark lord, but I escaped.|
|3|The others took their own lives to ascend. I could not.|
|4|I no longer believed in what we were doing. It seemed wrong, somehow.|

</div>

### Feature: Secret Signs
You know the secret symbology of your cult, which can pop up in some surprising places. With a subtle gesture or knowing handshake you can discern who follows the ways of your dark lord. Cloisters of your cult may be hidden across the galaxy, identified by the secret signs and symbols designed to lead the faithful to places of dark worship. Such cloistered often contain enough lodging and food for at least ten people, for a week, and sometimes harbor eldritch treasures belonging to the cult.

|5|**Secrets**. The lore of my cult is historically important, and I should preserve it. (Neutral)|

## Faction Adventurer
Adventuring is nothing new to you. Due to the circumstances of how you were raised, you have been involved with wandering heroes for most of your life. Maybe you were part of an adventuring band previously, but split with them after a disagreement or tragedy. Or, perhaps you worked around heroes in a lesser role for most of your young life, and you are now ready to graduate to the front lines.

- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** 50 feet of rope, a small knife, a trophy, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 100 cr. 

#### Adventuring Origin
You have either been adventuring or assisting other in adventuring since a very young age. Perhaps your parents were famous adventurers, or a group of adventurers found and raised you as their own. Perhaps you were trained to be a professional monster hunter, or maybe another faction member saved your life so you swore loyalty to them. Work with your GM to determine the nature of your adventuring.

### Feature: Faction Membership
You are an established and respected member of an adventurer's faction, allowing you to rely on certain benefits that membership provides. If you are in a town with a headquarters for your adventurer's faction and you are in good standing with the faction, you will be allowed to look at the job postings and find adventuring work to earn money. 

factions often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your faction will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the faction, if you are a member in good standing. You must pay dues of 50 cr per month to the faction. Your dues must be current to remain in the faction's good graces.

### Background Feat
As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:

## Faction Artisan
You are a member of an artisan's faction, skilled in a particular field and closely associated with other artisans.

### Feature: Faction Membership
As an established and respected member of a faction, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow faction members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed.

## Faction Merchant
Instead of an artisans' faction, you might belong to a faction of traders, caravan masters, or shopkeepers. You don't craft items yourself but earn a living by buying and selling the works of others. Your faction might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the galaxy. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop. In some ways, the traveling merchant's life lends itself to adventure far more than the life of an artisan.

## Far Traveler
Almost all of the common people and other folk that one might encounter throughout the galaxy have one thing in common: they live  their lives without traveling more than a few miles from where they were born.

You aren't one of those folk.

You are from a distant place that few of the common folk realize exists; chances are good that even if some people have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and maybe a few outrageous stories. 

Although you find some of this land's ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be, to you, new wonders that you've never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you're a person of interest, for good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Insight, Investigation, Perception, and Persuasion
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One musical instrument or gaming set of your choice
- **Languages:** One of your choice

## Farmer
You are an experienced farmer, cultivating and harvesting nature for the provision of others. You have spent a lot of time surviving outside population centers, but know how to sell your product either directly or to merchants, legal or otherwise.  Because you deal with commodities, either as input or as produce, you know how to get things done and how to live on razor-thin margins. You have survived up to this point by working long, hard, and smart.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Animal Handling, Nature, Persuasion, and Technology
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One instrument and one type of artisan's implements or bioanalysis kit

## Gladiator
A gladiator is as much an entertainer as any minstrel or circus performer, trained to make the arts of combat into a spectacle the crowd can enjoy. This kind of flashy combat is your entertainer routine, though you might also have some skills as a tumbler or actor. Using your A Champion Well Known feature, you can find a place to perform in any place that features combat for entertainment—perhaps a gladiatorial arena or secret pit fighting club. 
___

- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of musical instrument

### Feature: A Champion Well Known
You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble's court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.

### Feature: Discovery
The seclusion of your hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. You might have discovered a great truth about the cosmos or the Force, a fact that has long been forgotten, a relic of the past that could rewrite history, or a place unseen for ages. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society. Work with your GM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.

## Imperial Knight

</div>

You are an Imperial Knight, a Force-wielding protector of the Fel Empire. Your order combines the teachings of the Jedi with the creed of the Royal Guard of old, using the Force as a powerful and respected tool with which to serve the Force as embodied by your Emperor. Imperial Knights do not share the philosophies of the Jedi with regards to the Force and its light side, and are well aware of the dangers of the dark side, dutifully rejecting its use and temptations. 

While Imperial Knights wield and construct their own lightsabers, they assign them no ceremonial value, treating them as nothing more than tools. As such, almost all lightsabers of the Imperial Knights look the same, with uniform hilt design and signature silver blades. These blades are produced by synthetic crystals similar to the red variety used by the Sith, created with knowledge from Emperor Palpatine's *Book of Anger*, but in a process bereft of the dark side. Imperial Knights are also recognized by their crimson armor emblazoned with the insignia of the Empire and ideally crafted of lightsaber-resistant materials.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Athletics, Intimidation, Perception, or Piloting
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Armormech's implements and artificer's implements
- **Equipment:** a revised copy of the *Book of Anger*, an Imperial insignia, a black cape with a hood, and a belt pouch containing 100 cr

### Feature: Will of the Emperor
The authority granted by your position is easily acknowledged even by those who don't recognize the Imperial Knights. Though they might not know you, common citizens will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you. Unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself facing an enemy alone.

### Background Feat
As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:

<div style='column-count:2'>

|d8|Feat|

|4|Ace Pilot|

|d8|Feat|
|:--:|:--:|
|5|Crafter|
|6|Force-Sensitive|
|7|Armor Expert|
|8|Weapon Expert|

</div>

#### Suggested Characteristics
Imperial Knights are warriors first, not negotiators. Their bonds are shaped by the great value they put in teamwork with their fellow Knights, as well as their loyalty to their Emperor. Their flaws may lie in their hubris, sense of superiority, or overzealousness in banishing the dark side. Some Knights hold ideals that lie beyond their order, for better or worse.

|d8|Personality Trait|

|1|If a crisis comes, my place will be at the Emperor's side.|

## Jensaarai
You are a Jensaarai, a Force user who has come to understand the failings of both Jedi inactivity and Sith malevolence. While they wield lightsabers, a true mark of skill among the Jensaarai is the crafting of their armor. Each suit is perfectly unique to the wearer, and is frequently (but not always) adorned and shaped to represent an animal that the Jensaarai finds kinship with, up to and potentially including additional mounted weapons or sensors to further emulate that creature.

While the Jensaarai train in, and will use dark side powers when necessary, they seek to avoid true corruption. They are not evil, nor are they wholly good either. They are anti-heroes, and well-practiced in this craft. In addition, the Jensaarai train in more than the lightsaber, employing whatever tools are at hand to best fit the job.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Insight, Intimidation, Lore, and Perception
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Armormech's implements
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of common clothes including a robe, a sturdy knife, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

### Feature: Depths of Duality
Due to the corruption of the Jedi training done to the pre-Jensaarai, you have a unique insight into both the Light and Dark side of the Force, as well as its history, applications, and techniques in a scholarly manner.

You are well versed in the above concepts, and can recall key information related to them. However, if the research was hidden from the public and you have not had experience working with it, you can only partially understand it. You also recognize well-known Jedi Masters and Sith Lords by their works and marks.

### Background Feat
As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:

|:--:|:--:|
|5|Crafter|
|6|Linguist|
|7|Alert|
|8|Observant|

</div>

#### Suggested Characteristics
Jensaarai are shaped by the unique capacity of their upbringing. Their study of the duality of the Force manifests in their mannerisms and ideals. Their bond might be their family or their armor. Their flaws might be some a hatred of the Jedi or Sith or a desire to become one or the other.

But Jizz is more than the music. It's about wandering the galaxy and living out of a suitcase. It's about playing the sleaziest cantinas you can find and having a good time while you do it. Jizz is the music of freedom and freedom loving people. Jizz is Life and Life is Jizz.

## Lawyer
Your duty is to uphold the law. Before becoming an adventurer you resided over a court or tribunal, managing proceedings and sentencing criminals to punishments fit for their crimes. Your job required a deep understanding of the law which you used to resolve conflicts both clear-cut and morally grey.

The legal system on the planet where you worked has a large effect on how you view the law. Was it a court system with a jury making the final verdict, or did you have absolute authority over determining guilt and sentencing? Was it a fair legal system with plenty of integrity, or was it rife with abuse and corruption? Did you work on criminal cases, civil law, or something even more specific? Perhaps instead of working for a government you were a judge in an internal tribunal for a temple or military organization. 

Consider what compelled you to leave your old occupation behind and begin adventuring. Perhaps you seek to bring someone beyond the scope of law to justice, or maybe you have lost faith in the legal system altogether and have turned to a vigilante approach. 
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Insight, Investigation, Performance, and Persuasion
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** Documentation of your station, a book of law, a formal uniform you wear to court, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 100 cr. 

### Feature: Legal Authority
You are familiar with the letter of the law and workings of courts, at least on the planet that you were a judge in. If you are in a foreign place where you are not familiar with their exact laws, you often will be able to track down the resources you need to learn them. 

If you or your party gets into legal trouble, your experience may help you get out of it. If you can prove your credentials, you might be able to represent your party in a court of law without admonishment. You may know of legal loopholes that will help your case. If you are in the region where you originally worked, you might have past connections with many legal professionals there.

## Student
As a child, you were inquisitive when your playmates were possessive or raucous. In your formative years, you found your way to one of the galaxy's great institutes of learning, where you were apprenticed and taught that knowledge is a more valuable treasure than gold or gems. Now you are ready to leave your home- not to abandon it, but to quest for new lore to add to its storehouse of knowledge.

The most well-known of the galaxy's fonts of knowledge is the Library of the Republic. The great library is always in need of workers and attendants, some of whom rise through the ranks to assume roles of greater responsibility and prominence. You might be one of Coruscant's own, dedicated to the curatorship of what is likely the most complete body of lore and history in all the world.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Insight, Lore, Investigation, and Nature
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of common clothes, a datapad and 10 data cards, a book on the subject of your current study, and a pouch containing 100 cr

### Feature: Library Access
Though others must often endure extensive interviews and significant fees to gain access to even the most common archives in your library, you have free and easy access to the majority of the library, though it might also have repositories of lore that are too valuable, powerful, or secret to permit anyone immediate access.

You have a working knowledge of your cloister's personnel and bureaucracy, and you know how to navigate those connections with some ease.

Additionally, you are likely to gain preferential treatment at other libraries across the galaxy, as professional courtesy shown to a fellow scholar.

Further, when you hear a creature speaking or when you see language written down, you can identify exactly what language is being used even if you are not proficient in the language.

## Urchin
You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor. You had no one to watch over you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other desperate souls who might steal from you. You slept on rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or a place to recuperate. You've survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of each.

You begin your adventuring career with enough money to live modestly but securely for at least ten days. How did you come by that money? What allowed you to break free of your desperate circumstances and embark on a better life?
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Insight, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Disguise kit, security kit
- **Equipment:** A small knife, a map of the city you grew up in, a pet mouse, a token to remember your parents by, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 100 cr

### Feature: City of Secrets
You know the secret patterns and flows to cities and can find passages through the urban sprawl that others would miss. When you are not in combat, you (and companions you lead) can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow.

### Background Feat
As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:

|5|Specialist|
|6|Alert|
|7|Athlete|
|8|Observant|

</div>

#### Suggested Characteristics
Urchins are shaped by lives of desperate poverty, for good and for ill. They tend to be driven either by a commitment to the people with whom they shared life on the street or by a burning desire to find a better life— and maybe get some payback on all the rich people who treated them badly.
