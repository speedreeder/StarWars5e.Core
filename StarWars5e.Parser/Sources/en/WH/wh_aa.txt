#### Atmospheric Decanting Vessel
_**Adventuring gear**, <font style="color:green">**premium**</font>_<br>
This metal jug appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty.

You can use an action and name one liquid from the table below to cause the jug to produce the chosen liquid. Afterward, you can open the jug as an action and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid you named.

Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn.

<div style='column-count:2'>

| Liquid | Quantity |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Acid  | 8 ounces |
| Alcohol, strong  | 1 gallon |
| Alcohol, weak  | 4 gallons |
| Basic poison  | 1/2 ounce |

| Liquid | Quantity |
|:---:|:------------|
| Condiment | 2 gallons |
| Lubricant | 1 quart |
| Water, potable | 8 gallons |
| Water, stagnant | 12 gallons |

#### Aratech Sound Dampening Boots
_**Adventuring gear** (feet), <font style="color:green">**premium**</font>_<br>
_**Requires attunement**_<br>
While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently. 

_Before their repulsorcraft hit it big, Aratech honed its edge in the stealth field generator market._

#### Boots of Bounding
_**Adventuring gear** (feet), <font style="color:blue">**prototype**</font>_<br>
_**Requires attunement**_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** at least 3 levels in fighter_<br>
This item can hold a number of charges equal to half your fighter level (rounded up). When you complete a long rest, this item regains all missing charges. On your turn, you can expend 1 or more charges to engage the rocket boosters and leap to a space you can see. For each charge spent, you can move up to 10 feet. Any opportunity attacks you provoke with this movement are made with disadvantage.

When you reach 5th level in fighter, when you use your Action Surge feature, your movement speed is doubled for the turn, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of your turn, though you fall if you end your speed in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft, and opportunity attacks made against you this turn have disadvantage.

When you reach 11th level in fighter, when you use your Indomitable feature, you have advantage on the roll.

When you reach 17th level in fighter, once per round, when you miss with a weapon attack, you can repeat the attack (no action required).

_These red and black boots come with integrated rocket boosters._

A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that the footprints are false. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

This ring stores tech powers cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 8 levels worth of tech powers at a time. When found, it contains 1d9 - 1 levels of stored tech powers chosen by the GM.

Any creature can cast a tech power of 1st through 8th level into the ring by touching the ring as the tech power is cast. The tech power has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can't hold the tech power, the tech power is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the tech power determines how much space it uses.

While wearing this ring, you can cast any tech power stored in it. The tech power uses the slot level, tech save DC, tech attack bonus, and techcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the tech power. The tech power cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

#### Aratech Echo Belt
_**Adventuring gear** (waist), <font style="color:green">**premium**</font>_<br>
_**Requires attunement**_<br>
While you wear this belt with its field on, Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, as the belt funnels light around you. Activating or deactivating the belt takes an action.

_The success of this high-end stealth field generator emboldened Aratech to branch out into other hardware._

#### Baragwin Stealth Unit
_**Adventuring gear** (waist), <font style="color:#dd6b20">**legendary**</font>_<br>
_**Requires attunement**_<br>
While wearing this belt, you can turn on its stealth field to cause yourself to become invisible. While you are invisible, anything you are carrying or wearing is invisible with you. You become visible when you turn off the field. Turning the field on or off requires an action.

Deduct the time you are invisible, in increments of 1 minute, from the belt's maximum duration of 2 hours. After 2 hours of use, the belt ceases to function. For every uninterrupted period of 12 hours the belt goes unused, it regains 1 hour of use.

_Those Baragwin who sought to turn their telepathic empathy into an asset for bounty hunting needed something special to overcome the drawbacks of their lumbering frames._

#### CNS Strength Enhancer
_**Adventuring gear** (waist), <font style="color:purple">**advanced**</font>_<br>
_**Requires attunement**_<br>
While wearing this belt, your Strength score becomes 23. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than 23, it has no effect on you.

_This belt further increases a users physical power with pneumaticized assistance joists and a repulsorfield microgenerator._

\columnbreak

#### Defel Mimicker
_**Adventuring gear** (waist), prototype_</font><br>
_**Requires attunement**_<br>
While you wear this belt, it casts a shadow that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.

_The only visible trace of this stealth field generator's user is a vague shadow, much like the Defel themselves._

#### Dominator Belt
_**Adventuring gear** (waist), <font style="color:red">**artifact**</font>_<br>
_**Requires attunement**_<br>
While wearing this belt, your Strength score becomes 29. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than 29, it has no effect on you.

_While only barely adhering to the most technical definition of a belt, this harness-like rig of pneumaticized limb actuators supplies enormous strength to every limb of its wearer's body, monstrously increasing their physical power._

#### GNS Strength Enhancer
_**Adventuring gear** (waist), <font style="color:#dd6b20">**legendary**</font>_<br>
_**Requires attunement**_<br>
While wearing this belt, your Strength score becomes 25. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than 25, it has no effect on you.

_This large belt greatly increases a users physical power with an array of repulsorfield microgenerators and a pair of reactive-lift actuators that increase raw force and lift-capacity without any loss of speed or fine motor skills._

#### Sith Strength Belt
_**Adventuring gear** (waist), <font style="color:#dd6b20">**legendary**</font>_<br>
_**Requires attunement**_<br>
While wearing this belt, your Strength score becomes 27. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than 27, it has no effect on you.

_Worn on the legs, waist and lower back, this belt massively increases a users physical power with a set of heavy durasteel actuators alongside an synaptic monitoring system that reacts to its users motion with optimized power responses._

#### Strength Enhancer 
_**Adventuring gear** (waist), <font style="color:blue">**prototype**</font>_<br>
_**Requires attunement**_<br>
While wearing this belt, your Strength score becomes 21. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than 21, it has no effect on you.

_This belt increases a users physical power with pneumaticized assistance joists that provide support and leverage in a minimal form-factor._

#### Vambraces of the Outrider
_**Adventuring gear** (forearms), <font style="color:blue">**prototype**</font>_<br>
_**Requires attunement**_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** at least 3 levels in scout_<br>
This item can hold a number of charges equal to half your scout level (rounded up). When you complete a long rest, this item regains all missing charges. When you cast a tech power of 1st level or higher, you can expend one or more charges to reduce the tech power's cost by 1 per charge spent, to a minimum of 1.

When you reach 5th level in scout, you can maintain two targets of your Ranger's Quarry feature, instead of one. Additionally, the reload value of the wrist launcher increases by 1, to 2.

When you reach 11th level in scout, when you are forced to make a concentration check by the target of your Ranger's Quarry, you have advantage on the check and add your Intelligence modifier to the roll. Additionally, the reload value of the wrist launcher increases by 1, to 3.

When you reach 17th level in scout, when you miss with a tech or weapon attack, the target takes damage equal to the attack's governing ability modifier. If the target of the attack is the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature, you can choose to deal your Ranger's Quarry damage as well. Additionally, the reload value of the wrist launcher increases by 1, to 4.

_This pair of matching vambraces are inlaid with the etched visage of an eagle. One contains an integrated wristpad, while the other contains an integrated wrist launcher._

#### Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook
_**Adventuring gear** (forearm), <font style="color:#4a5568">**standard**</font>_<br>
You craft a wrist-mounted grappling hook weapon attached to a tightly coiled cord. With this grappler, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60. On a hit, it deals 1d4 kinetic damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.

A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the hook. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the hook. Removing the hook requires a DC 13 Strength check. While the hook is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.

While the hook is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is your size or larger. A creature or object smaller than you is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover and reinsert the hook as an action.

This armor has no weight and does not affect encumbrance. While wearing it, you are considered proficient regardless of whether or not you have proficiency with heavy armor, and you are resistant to all unenhanced damage.

***Cursed.*** You can not remove this armor without first killing the orbalisks. While wearing this armor, whenever you complete a long rest, you must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. You can choose to fail this saving throw. For each saving throw you fail, the size of your Hit Die is reduced by one step (from d12 to d10, from d10 to d8, from d8 to d6, from d6 to d4, or from d4 to d2). If you fail a saving throw while your Hit Die is a d2, you die as the orbalisks consume you. Additionally, for each saving throw you fail, your AC increases by 1.

While this mode is active, you cannot be deafened. Additionally, if you listen to any spoken language for 10 minutes, the software in this package will begin to attempt to decipher it. Make an Intelligence (Lore) check, DC determined by the GM depending on the rarity of the language. On a success, you can understand the spoken form of this language, and speak it if your species' vocal capabilities allow for it.
- **Interceptor Mode:** This is a jamming and electronic warfare suite that includes a comm jammer, a holotrace device and pocket scrambler. Additionally, you can attempt to listen in on nearby audio communications chatter such as from a comlink or holocomm as an action. Make an Intelligence (Technology) check, DC determined by the GM depending on the sophistication of the technology. On a success, you can hear electronic communications originating from within 100 feet.
- **Respirator Mode:** This includes a basic respirator that grants advantage on saving throws made to avoid being poisoned and resistance to poison damage. Additionally, you do not need air to breathe, allowing you to survive even in vacuum for up to 1 hour.

**Side Effect:** This complex interface causes significant interference with other communication devices, rendering them impossible to use. While this implant is installed, you can not use any portable device used for communication or jamming, such as a commlink or holotrace device.

Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d6 energy damage from the hit.
