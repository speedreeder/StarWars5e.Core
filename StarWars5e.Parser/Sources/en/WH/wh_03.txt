&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">s characters travel through the cities and worlds of</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Star Wars*, they may come across factions, such as the Jedi Order, the Black Sun, or the Bounty Broker's Association, to which they may want to pledge service. Joining a faction offers unique benefits, as determined by the faction's features.

## Joining a Faction
A character can join a faction at any time, provided they can find a faction member capable of recruiting and they are not in bad standing with the faction. If a character is in bad standing with a faction that they wish to join, and they can find a nonhostile representative of that faction, they may be able to complete a task to return to the faction's favor, as determined by the GM.

The requirements for joining a faction vary based on the the faction you are trying to join. The Jedi Order, for instance, might require you to be a certain age and Force-sensitive. The Bounty Broker's Association, however, simply require monthly dues.

> #### Factions and Backgrounds
> If a character is of an appropriate background, such as Jedi or Guild Merchant, can start at at least 1st rank in their faction, as determined by the GM.

### Membership Benefits
As an established and respected member of a faction, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow faction members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a headquarters offers a central place to meet other members of your faction, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.

Factions often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your faction will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the faction, if you are a member in good standing. Your dues must be current to remain in the faction's good graces.

### Membership Dues
After joining a faction, characters have certain requirements they must meet in order to retain in their faction's good standing. For some factions, it might simply be credit dues paid at the beginning of the month. For other factions, they might require you spend one workweek a month furthering their interests.

#### Overdue 
If at the end of a month you are not current in your dues, you must become current again before you can gain any benefits from your faction. For every month you are not current in your dues, you must account for the missed dues for each month before you can become current again. 

\columnbreak

&emsp;For instance, if your faction requires a credit tithe, you must meet the missed tithe for each month before you become current again. If your faction requires a workweek of downtime, however, you must complete a workweek for each month you are behind.

If you ever become overdue by a year or more, you lose your membership in that faction entirely unless you can justify that the absence was beyond your control. If you can not justify your absence and you choose to rejoin your faction, you start over at 1st rank.

### Membership in Multiple Factions
You can have ranks in multiple factions as long as those factions are not in direct conflict, but your total combined ranks across all your factions can not exceed half your character level (rounded up). If you complete a task that aligns with the goals of one of your factions, but is in direct conflict with another faction, you risk lowing renown with the other faction, or potentially being disavowed entirely.

### Faction Ranks
Factions can have a maximum of five ranks. While the names and responsibilities of each rank vary by faction, their general structure tends to be the same.

#### Rank 1: Initiate
This is the rank a character receives when first joining a faction. 

#### Rank 2: Member
Rank 2 characters have shown they're aligned with the faction's goals, allowing greater responsibility.

#### Rank 3: Veteran
Rank 3 characters are reliable faction members, entrusted with many secrets and deserving of additional support.

#### Rank 4: Officer
Rank 4 characters are trusted within the faction's leadership. They are looked up as champions of a faction's endeavors, and are the leaders of individual faction locations.

#### Rank 5: Leader
Rank 5 characters are the leaders of their respective factions. Typically, a faction has one singular leader per headquarters, who delegates responsibilities to the faction's rank 4 and lower characters.

A faction can not have more rank 5 characters than its tier. If a faction has more than one rank 5 character, typically one stands above the rest.

### Rising through the Ranks
When a character completes an endeavor, such as a downtime activity or mission, that aligns with the goals of their faction, they gain renown. As a character reaches certain thresholds of renown, they earn the opportunity to rise through the ranks of their faction, provided they meet any other requirements, as shown in the Membership Ranks table on page \-\-\-.

## Factions
Faction can vary greatly in size and renown, from a lowly local adventurer's guild to a galaxy-spanning criminal organization. The nature of factions drastically differ as well, depending on the faction's intended focus. 

### Faction Tiers
Factions vary in tier depending on their size. Smaller factions will typically hover between tier 1 and tier 5, while larger, galaxy-spanning factions might reach tier 20. Higher tiers require more active members, but grant greater benefits to them, as shown in the Faction Benefits table on page \-\-\-.

#### Proficiency Bonus
Factions have their own proficiency bonus, which scales with their tier. This proficiency bonus affects actions that faction takes as a whole, or actions taken by members of appropriate rank, in the ability scores in which the faction is proficient.

#### Ability Scores 
Ability scores represent what a faction choose to focus on for its enterprises. Their are six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Ability scores are discussed at greater length in Chapter 4: Using Ability Scores.

### Faction Traits
Every faction is unique, not just in how they function, but also their goals, beliefs, and what kind of members they attract.

#### Goals
Each faction has its own goals. One of the most common goals many factions share is the desire for increased wealth and influence. Many factions, however, have goals unique to their own efforts. For instance, a faction might have a goal of maintaining peace and prosperity in their region, directing all of their wealth and influence towards that one goal.

#### Beliefs
Each faction also has its own beliefs. Many nefarious factions, such as the Exchange, believe power should be wielded by the strong, and that the weak deserve to be enslaved, while a more monetarily motivated faction, such as the Commerce Guild, believe that material wealth is the greatest source of control.

#### Member Traits
Members of a faction are often drawn to it because they share common traits with its members. For instance, criminals who prefer to work alone, or in small groups, might be drawn to the Black Sun, while bounty hunters might choose to join the Bounty Broker's Association to earn greater wealth and prestige.

### Headquarters
Most factions have use of a headquarters. For smaller factions, it might be a simple building, or even a room. For larger factions, however, it might be a space ship, a space station, or even an entire moon or planet. A faction headquarters is required to recruit members to a faction.

A faction can have any number of headquarters, provided it has the staff and funds to maintain them. However, every headquarters requires at least one 4th rank or higher member to administrate.

#### Operating Costs
Beyond the required costs for actually maintaining a headquarters, factions have costs directly associated with their functions. These fees might cover licensing fees, bribes, government contracts, etc. These fees amount to roughly 1,000 cr per headquarters per month.

### Recruiting
In order for a faction to grow, it must recruit members. While lower tier factions can thrive with only a few members, higher tier factions require constant effort by thousands or more members. Additionally, a smaller faction might have trouble recruiting skilled members, while larger factions probably don't. 

Each membership rank can only support members of a certain CR or higher, as shown in the Membership Ranks CR and Renown table below.

##### Membership Ranks CR and Renown
|Membership<br> Rank|Minimum<br> Member CR|Monthly Renown<br> Generation|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|1|1/8|1|
|2|1/2|2|
|3|1|3|
|4|2|4|
|5|5|5|

Additionally, certain NPCs might also require a higher tier to join your faction. For instance, a skilled craftsman might not have a high CR, but might still require a faction to be a higher tier to merit joining.

### Renown
Characters who act on behalf of their faction's interest earn renown, improving their own standing within their faction as well as their faction's overall effectiveness. In order for a faction to increase in tier, it must have a specific amount of renown, as shown in the Faction Benefits table on page \-\-\-. Additionally, once a faction reaches tier 6, it must have a certain amount of renown generated each month in order to progress to subsequent tiers.

NPC faction members generate an amount of renown each month determined by their rank in the faction, as shown in the Membership Ranks CR and Renown table above.
