<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:29px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">ool proficiencies are a useful way to highlight a</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; character's background and talents. At the game table, though, the use of tools sometimes overlaps with the use of skills, and it can be unclear how to use them together in certain situations. This section offers various ways that tools can be used in the game.

To make tool proficiencies more attractive choices for the characters, you can use the methods outlined below.

## Tool Descriptions
The following sections go into detail about the tools presented in Chapter 5, as well as those present in the *Player's Handbook*, offering advice on how to use them in a campaign.

The first paragraph in each description gives details on what a set of tools is made up of. A character who is proficient with a tool knows how to use all of its component parts.

#### Skills 
Every tool potentially provides bonuses on a check when used in conjunction with certain skills, provided a character is proficient with both the tool and the skill. Each tool grants bonuses to three skills.

With respect to skills, the system is mildly abstract in terms of what a tool proficiency represents; essentially, it assumes that a character who has proficiency with a tool also has learned about facets of the trade or profession that are not necessarily associated with the use of the tool.

***Advantage.*** If the use of a tool and the use of a skill both apply to a check, and a character is proficient with the tool and the skill, consider allowing the character to make the check with advantage. This simple benefit can go a long way toward encouraging players to pick up tool proficiencies. In the tool descriptions that follow, this benefit is often expressed as additional insight (or something similar), which translates into an increased chance that the check will be a success.

***Added Benefit.*** Additionally, consider giving characters who have both a relevant skill and a relevant tool proficiency an added benefit on a successful check. This benefit might be in the form of more detailed information or could simulate the effect of a different sort of successful check. For instance, a character proficient with constructor's implements makes a successful Wisdom (Perception) check to find a secret door in a wall. Not only does the character notice the door's presence, but you decide that the tool proficiency entitles the character to an automatic success on an Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine how to open the door.

#### Other Tools
Additionally, at the GM's discretion, certain tools might grant bonuses when used in conjunction with another tool, provided a character is proficient with both. For instance, if a character is proficient with both munitions kits and armstech's implements, you might grant them advantage on checks they make with either tool.

### Special Use
Proficiency with a tool usually brings with it a particular benefit in the form of a special use, as described in this paragraph. During a short or long rest, you can only activate the special use of one of your tools.

#### Sample DCs
A table at the end of each section lists activities that a tool can be used to perform, and suggested DCs for the necessary ability checks.
