<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:29px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">he combination of ability scores, species, class, and</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; background defines your character's capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and species, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for players who—with the GM's permission—want to go a step further.

This chapter expands on feats, which are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels. Your GM decides whether these options are available in a campaign.

#### Class Weapon Proficiencies
Certain classes—berserker, consular, engineer, fighter, guardian, and scout—have proficiency in all of a type of weapon. For instance, fighters are proficient in all blasters and all vibroweapons. Consequently, fighters have proficiency in all blasters and vibroweapons present in Chapter 5. Other classes—monks, operatives, scholars, and sentinels—have proficiency in a certain set of weapons. For each of these classes, they gain proficiency in only certain weapons, as shown below in the Weapon Proficiencies by Class table:

##### Weapon Proficiencies by Class
|Class|Weapon Proficiencies|
|:--|:--|
|Berserker|All vibroweapons, simple blasters|
|Consular|Simple lightweapons, simple vibroweapons|
|Engineer|Simple blasters, simple vibroweapons|
|Fighter|All blasters, all vibroweapons|
|Guardian|All lightweapons, all vibroweapons|
|Monk|Simple blasters, simple vibroweapons, bolas|
|Operative|Simple vibroweapons, simple blasters, bolas, electrobaton, incinerator pistol, riot baton, riot shocker, sonic pistol, vibroknife, wristblade|
|Scholar|Simple blasters, simple vibroweapons, electrobaton, incinerator pistol, sonic pistol, vibroknife|
|Scout|All blasters, all vibroweapons|
|Sentinel|Simple vibroweapons, simple lightweapons, bolas, chained dagger, chained lightdagger, electrobaton, electrostaff, guard shoto, lightfist, riot baton, riot shocker, vibroshield, vibroknife, vibrotonfa, war hat, wristblade|

## Feats
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Inspiring Leader feat requires you to have a Charisma of 13 or higher. If your Charisma is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering curse—you can't benefit from the Inspiring Leader feat until your Charisma is restored.

### Augmented Cyborg
You've experimented with cybernetic augmentations, granting the following benefits: 
- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Choose one cybernetic augmentation of standard rarity from Appendix A. That augmentation is installed and doesn't count against the maximum cybernetic augmentations you can support, but it does count towards your total cybernetics augmentations as shown in the Cybernetic Augmentations Side Effects table in Chapter 7.

### Customized Droid
_**Prerequisite:** Type droid_<br>
You've been customized beyond other droids of the same model, granting the following benefits: 
- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Choose one droid customization of standard rarity from Appendix A. That customization is installed and doesn't count against the maximum droid customizations you can support, but it does count towards your maximum parts or protocols, as appropriate.

- Your maximum attunement increases by 1.

- Once per long rest, you can choose one object that you must touch for 10 minutes.

You learn whether any powers are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a power, you learn which power created it.

### Savage Shorty

You can't use heavy shields or martial weapons with the two-handed property unless it has the light property, and if a martial weapon has the versatile property, you can only wield it in two-hands.

### Weapon Focused

## Weapon Focus

</div>

The Weapon Focused feat offers your choice of weapon focus. You can't take a weapon focus option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

> #### Alternative Weapon Focus
> Your weapon of choice may be governed by one weapon focus, whereas your character can be better realized utilizing a different focus. For instance, your blaster rifle might work better for you with Carbine Focus rather than Rifle Focus. Work with your GM to determine if a different focus is better suited, and mechanically appropriate, to your character's identity.
>
> A weapon's focus and supremacy must match.

You may choose your weapon focus from the following options or roll on the table below to determine it randomly.
