<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:29px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">he combination of ability scores, species, class, and</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; background defines your character's capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and species, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for players who—with the GM's permission—want to go a step further.

This chapter expands on feats, which are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels. Your GM decides whether these options are available in a campaign.

### Fighting Styles and Masteries
Wretched Hives introduces new ammunition types, such as the specialized power cells, or rockets. You'll want to extend the benefits of certain Fighting Styles and Fighting Masteries to these new munitions, as explained below.

#### Explosives Style and Mastery
You will want to extend the benefits of this pair to include rockets.

#### Area Style and Mastery
You will want to extend the benefits of this pair to include flechette clips, flechette mags, and projector tanks.

#### Gunning Style and Mastery
You'll want to extend the benefits of this pair to include specialized power cells and slug cartridges.

### Class Proficiencies
Certain classes, such as fighters or guardians, gain proficiency in all weapons within a specific category. For instance, fighters gain proficiency in all blasters and vibroweapons, and guardians gain proficiency in all lightweapons and vibroweapons. Monk, operative, scholar, and sentinel, on the other hand, only gain proficiency in martial weapons that meet certain criteria. If that criteria is met due to the use of an item or feature that add—or remove—a referenced property, this does not grant that class proficiency in the weapon. For instance, operatives gain proficiency in simple blasters, simple vibroweapons, martial blasters that lack the auto, special, strength, and two-handed properties, martial vibroweapons with the finesse property. If they add the finesse property to a vibroweapon, or remove the strength property from a blaster weapon, this would not grant the operative proficiency in that weapon.

## Feats
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Inspiring Leader feat requires you to have a Charisma of 13 or higher. If your Charisma is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering curse—you can't benefit from the Inspiring Leader feat until your Charisma is restored.

### Augmented Cyborg
_**Prerequisite:** Type beast or humanoid_<br>
You've experimented with cybernetic augmentations, granting the following benefits: 
- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Choose one cybernetic augmentation of standard rarity from Appendix A. That augmentation is installed and doesn't count against the maximum cybernetic augmentations you can support, but it does count towards your total cybernetics augmentations as shown in the Cybernetic Augmentations Side Effects table in Chapter 7.

### Customized Droid
_**Prerequisite:** Type droid_<br>
You've been customized beyond other droids of the same model, granting the following benefits: 
- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Choose one droid customization of standard rarity from Appendix A. That customization is installed and doesn't count against the maximum droid customizations you can support, but it does count towards your maximum parts or protocols, as appropriate.

### Investigative Attunement
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
You've spent a significant amount of time appraising and testing enhanced items. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Your maximum attunement increases by 1.
- You have advantage on ability checks made to identify items.
- Once per long rest, you can choose one object that you must touch for 10 minutes. If it is an enhanced or modified item, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any powers are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a power, you learn which power created it.

### Muscled Menace
_**Prerequisite:** Strength 13, size Medium_<br>
Despite being of otherwise average size, your might extends beyond that of your peers. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Your speed increases by 5 feet.
- You can't add more than +3 when determining your bonus to AC from your Dexterity.
- You can't add more than +3 when determing your bonus to Dexterity saving throws from Dexterity.
- You gain the Oversized special trait: ***Oversized.*** Light- and vibro-weapons that lack the dexterity or light property are considered to have the heavy property for you. The strength number for blasters is reduced by one step (from 19 to 17, 17 to 15, 15 to 13, or 13 to 11). If the strength number is 11, you ignore it entirely. 

### Savage Shorty

- Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Your speed increases by 5 feet.
- You lose the Undersized special trait.

\columnbreak

### Tiny Terror
_**Prerequisite:** Strength 13, size Tiny_<br>
Despite falling below knee height of other species, your size has less impact on your strength and virility. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Your speed increases by 5 feet.
- You lose the Pintsized special trait, and you are no longer limited to +3 when determining your bonus to attack and damage rolls for weapon attacks using Strength due to the Puny special trait.
- You gain the Undersized special trait: ***Undersized.*** Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons. You can't use heavy shields or martial weapons with the two-handed property unless it has the light property, and if a martial weapon has the versatile property, you can only wield it in two-hands.

### Weapon Focused
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>

## Weapon Focus

</div>

The Weapon Focused feat offers your choice of weapon focus. You can't take a weapon focus option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

> #### Alternative Weapon Focus
> Your weapon of choice may be governed by one weapon focus, whereas your character can be better realized utilizing a different focus. For instance, your blaster rifle might work better for you with Carbine Focus rather than Rifle Focus. Work with your GM to determine if a different focus is better suited, and mechanically appropriate, to your character's identity.
>
> A weapon's focus and supremacy must match.

You may choose your weapon focus from the following options or roll on the table below to determine it randomly.
