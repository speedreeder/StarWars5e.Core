## Addicted Approach
For some, the consumption of substances is the entirety of their life. For berserkers of the Addicted Approach, substances cause their fury to burn stronger and deeper, granting significant benefits.

### Slythmonger Savvy
_**Addicted Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in your choice of brewer's kit or spicer's kit. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid the low or addiction to substances. Lastly, you can consume substances as a bonus action, and when you do so, you can also enter a rage as a part of this same bonus action.

### Freedom Through Slavery
_**Addicted Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
While you are raging or experiencing the high of a substance, you have advantage on saving throws that would force you to act against your will, be frightened, or prevent you from attacking a creature. If you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, you are instead immune to effects that would force you to act against your will or would prevent you<br> from attacking a creature.

### Release the Beast
_**Addicted Approach:** 6th level_<br>
While you are raging or experiencing the high of a substance, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a Hit Die to deal additional damage to the target. Roll the Hit Die, adding the result of the die to the damage roll. If you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, you also add your Constitution modifier to the damage roll.

### Seeing Sound
_**Addicted Approach:** 10th level_<br>
While you are raging or experiencing the high of a substance, you have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. If you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, you instead have blindsight with a range of 30 feet. If you would already have blindsight, it instead increases by 5 feet or 15 feet, respectively.

### Fuel the Rampage
_**Addicted Approach:** 14th level_<br>
While you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, having 0 hit points doesn't knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don't die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.

## Bloodstorm Approach
The Bloodstorm Approach is said to have originated from the ancient wookiee Hroufrasnooohn clan (which loosely translates to Bloodstorm in Galactic Basic), whose warriors performed gravity-defying feats with their flying vibroaxes through a combination of unorthodox techniques and a mystical belief in their own abilities. A berserker who follows this approach can hurl their devastating weapons at enemies with such power and skill that it completely blurs the line between melee and ranged combat.

### Furious Throw
_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
Your throwing techniques have become a perfect extension of your melee prowess. When you throw a weapon with which you are proficient, you can benefit from your class features that only apply to melee weapon attacks, such as Rage or Reckless Attack.

### Returning Attacks
_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
Any weapon you throw can ricochet back to you at your command. When you make a thrown weapon attack, you may have the weapon fly back to your hand immediately after the attack.

### Throw Anything
_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 6th level_<br>
Your strength and mastery of throwing techniques has allowed you to throw vibroaxes as easily as others hurl vibrodaggers. When you are wielding a light- or vibro-weapon with which you are proficient, it gains the thrown property (range 20/60).

### Fling People
_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 10th level_<br>
You learn to throw creatures as easily as you throw your weapons. When you successfully grapple a creature, you may immediately throw the creature.

#### Throw Friend
If the creature is a willing ally and volunteers<br> to be grappled, you throw the target into any unoccupied space within 60 feet. That creature<br> may immediately use its reaction to make one<br> melee weapon attack, adding your Strength<br> modifier to the attack's damage roll.

#### Throw Foe
If the creature is an opponent, you throw the target into any unoccupied space within 30 feet, where it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier and falls prone.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Raging Whirlwind
_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 14th level_<br>
You can send your weapon spinning into a gravity-defying whirlwind of pain. Once per rage as an action, you may throw a weapon with the thrown property to a point you choose within 60 feet. The weapon fills the air as a cyclone in a 10 foot radius sphere centered on that point. A creature takes damage equal to the thrown weapon's damage + your Strength modifier + your Rage Damage when it enter's the whirlwind's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. This effect ends when you command the weapon to return to you (no action required) or your rage ends.

## Brawling Approach
Most berserkers require weapons. For berserkers of the Brawling Approach, however, everything is their weapon.

### Fists of Fury
_**Brawling Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You've learned to hone your rage through your fists. Your unarmed strike damage increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).

### Reckless Strikes
_**Brawling Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
While you are raging, not wearing heavy armor, and not wielding a shield, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon, you can choose to forgo your rage damage to make the attack a reckless strike.

Some of your reckless strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the reckless strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**Reckless Strike save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Strength modifier

</div>

___

&emsp;You can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the berserker table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

#### Bracing Strike
You gain temporary hit points equal to your rage damage bonus. If the target is grappled by you, you instead gain temporary hit points equal to twice your rage damage bonus.

#### Punishing Strike
Your target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is deafened until the start of its next turn. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead incapacitated until the start of its next turn.

#### Staggering Strike
Your target must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (the target chooses the ability score to use). On a failed save, your target is pushed back 5 feet. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead knocked prone.

### Shattering Strikes
_**Brawling Approach:** 6th level_<br>
Your rage causes your strikes to overcome the hardest of materials. While raging, you gain the following benefits:
- Your unarmed strikes and improved weapons count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.
- Your unarmed strikes deal double damage against structures.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Stop Hitting Each Other
_**Brawling Approach:** 10th level_<br>
You can grapple creatures two sizes larger than you, instead of one. 

Additionally, you can use creatures you have grappled that are at least one size smaller than you as improvised weapons. When you do so, when you hit with an attack using a creature as a weapon, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. While raging, you can instead use creatures your size or smaller as improvised weapons.

### Enforcer
_**Brawling Approach:** 14th level_<br>
When you would make an unarmed strike or attack with an improvised weapon with advantage, you can choose to forgo the advantage. If you do so, your critical hit range increases by 1 for that attack, and on a hit, you deal maximum damage instead of rolling.

## Cyclone Approach
The Cyclone Approach empowers the berserker's ability to fight with weapons in each hand. Followers of this approach learn to move quickly to avoid attacks and can become a whirlwind of fury and steel, cleaving through hordes of enemies.

### Dual Wielder
_**Cyclone Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
When you engage in Two-Weapon Fighting, you can add your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) to the damage of your Two-Weapon Fighting attack as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.

### Double Swing
_**Cyclone Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
Once on each of your turns when you miss with an attack while raging, you can immediately make a melee attack with the weapon in your other hand. 

### Twisting Winds
_**Cyclone Approach:** 6th level_<br>
Your unpredictable movement makes you harder to hit and pin down. When you make a saving throw or ability checks to avoid being knocked prone, pushed, grappled, or restrained, it gains a bonus equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Mighty Leap
_**Cyclone Approach:** 10th level_<br>
The distance you can jump is doubled, and you do not provoke attacks of opportunity if you leave a hostile creature's reach while jumping.

### Tornado
_**Cyclone Approach:** 14th level_<br>
You can become a tornado of attacks. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your regular attacks to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. If you are wielding a separate melee weapon in each hand, each successful hit against a target deals damage equal to the damage dice of both weapons + your ability modifier + any other modifiers.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

\pagebreak

## Frenzied Approach
For some berserkers, rage is a means to an end—that end being violence. The Frenzied Approach is that of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

### Frenzy
_**Frenzied Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You can go into a frenzy when you enter your rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one.

The first time you use this feature, you suffer no ill effect. If you use this feature again before you finish<br> a long rest, you suffer one level of exhaustion<br> when your rage ends each time you use<br> it.

When you finish a long rest, you<br> reduce your exhaustion level by 2,<br> instead of 1. Additionally, any<br> effect that removes exhaustion<br> reduces your exhaustion by 1<br> additional level.

### Maniacal Rage
_**Frenzied Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
While raging, when you make a Charisma (Intimidation) check, or a creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to avoid being frightened of you, you add your Strength modifier to the check or save DC, as appropriate.

### Mindless Rage
_**Frenzied Approach:** 6th level_<br>
You can't be charmed or frightened while raging.<br> If you are charmed or frightened when you enter<br> your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration<br> of the rage.

### Intimidating Presence
_**Frenzied Approach:** 10th level_<br>
You can use your action to frighten someone with<br> your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, it becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours.

### Retaliation
_**Frenzied Approach:** 14th level_<br>
When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

## Industrial Approach
While some berserkers are content to surrender to their rage, others prefer a more tactful approach. Berserkers of the Industrial Approach augment their rage with the versatility of technology, adding elemental explosions to their already fearsome arsenal.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Techcasting
_**Industrial Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.

#### Tech Powers Known
You learn 3 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.

#### Tech Points
You have a number of tech points equal to half of your berserker level (rounded up), as shown in the Tech Points column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;table.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You may only cast tech powers at<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4th-level once. You regain the<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;ability to do so after a long rest.

#### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Techcasting Ability
Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___

<div align="center">

**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Intelligence modifier

___

**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br>your Intelligence modifier

</div>

___

#### Techcasting Focus
You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook) as a tech focus for your tech powers.

### Industrious Tech
_**Industrial Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You can cast tech powers while raging as long as the power's casting time is no more than 1 action and the power does not require concentration. While raging, you add your rage damage to damage rolls from tech powers you cast that require a tech attack or saving throw. If a tech power damages more than one target, you may only apply your rage damage to one of them. 

Casting tech powers during rage counts as attacking for the purposes of maintaining rage, and you can use your Reckless Attack feature to gain advantage when casting a tech power that requires a tech attack.

\pagebreak

### Explosive Resilience
_**Industrial Approach:** 6th level_<br>
Once per round, when you deal damage that includes your rage damage, you can cause a localized explosion around the recipient of that damage. Each creature within 5 feet of the damaged creature other than you takes acid, cold, fire, ion, or lightning damage (your choice) equal to your rage damage bonus, and you gain resistance to the chosen damage type until the end of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

### Painkiller
_**Industrial Approach:** 10th level_<br>
Whenever you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher, or deal damage using your Explosive Resilience feature, you can cause a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet to gain temporary hit points equal to half your berserker level (rounded up) + your Intelligence modifier. Additionally, while they have these temporary hit points, they have advantage on saving throws against effects that would cause them to be frightened.

### Final Countdown
_**Industrial Approach:** 14th level_<br>
When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, and you have at least one tech point remaining, you can expend all your remaining tech points and instead to drop to one hit point (no action required). If you do so, each creature within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, they take 1d12 acid, cold, fire, ion, or lightning damage (your choice) damage for each tech point spent in this way, or half as much on a successful one.

## Juggernaut Approach
Certain berserkers find that the strongest offense is a good defense. Berserkers of the Juggernaut Approach wear the heaviest of armor not because they fear injury, but to strike fear in their hapless attackers.

### Armored Brute
_**Juggernaut Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You've learned to fight in the heaviest of armors, using your weight to your advantage. You gain proficiency in heavy armor, you can enter a rage while wearing heavy armor, and you can gain the benefits of your Rage feature while wearing heavy armor. 

### Unstoppable Force
_**Juggernaut Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
Your momentum makes you nigh unstoppable. While raging, you can move through a hostile creature's space regardless of that creature's size. When you do so, you must make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check. If you move at least 10 feet before moving through a hostile creature's space, and that creature is your size or smaller, they have disadvantage on the check. If you succeed, you don't treat the movement as difficult terrain, the creature is pushed 5 feet in a direction of your choice, and you don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature until the end of your turn.

### Raging Bulwark
_**Juggernaut Approach:** 6th level_<br>
Your imposing form acts as a shield for your allies. When a friendly creature you can see is<br> the target of a ranged attack, or forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, and you can see the source<br> of the effect, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed towards the friendly creature. You must end this move closer to the ally than you started. If you end this movement between your ally and the source of the effect, you provide cover for the attack.

Additionally, you provide three-quarters cover, instead of half-cover, to creatures your size, and you provide full cover to creatures smaller than you.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Overwhelming Cleave
_**Juggernaut Approach:** 10th level_<br>
When you successfully push a creature into a surface or another creature while raging, the pushed creature takes kinetic damage equal to your Rage Damage. Additionally, the first time you hit with a melee weapon attack using Strength each turn, you can attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

### Relentless Assault
_**Juggernaut Approach:** 14th level_<br>
You're able to charge in unerring bursts. As an action, you can charge up to twice your speed in a straight line without provoking opportunity attacks. Each creature within 5 feet of your path must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier, the target chooses the ability they use use). On a failed save, a creature takes damage equal to your Strength modifier + your Rage Bonus and is pushed back 5 feet in a direction of your choice. Creatures smaller than you make this save with disadvantage. When you end this movement, if a creature is within 5 feet of you, you can make one melee weapon attack (no action required). On a hit, the creature takes additional damage equal to your berserker level.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete<br> a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Way of Confluence
The Force binds us, creating an intangible bridge connecting all living things. Those consulars who follow the Way of Confluence master this power, manipulating those connections to both sustain and torment.
 
### Manipulate Life Force
_**Way of Confluence:** 3rd level_<br>
When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a force power, or restore hit points to a creature with 0 hit points with a force power, you gain temporary hit points equal to half your consular level (rounded down) + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).

### Empowered Connection
_**Way of Confluence:** 6th level_<br>
While you have temporary hit points, you can add half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, rounded up, minimum of one) to any damage or healing you do with force powers that doesn't already include that modifier. 

### Life Eternal
_**Way of Confluence:** 10th level_<br>
You can use your powerful connection to the<br> Force to keep fighting when others would fall.<br> When you are reduced to 0 hit<br> points but not killed outright,<br> you can spend 5 force points to<br> drop to 1 hit point instead. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Interconnectedness
_**Way of Confluence:** 14th level_<br>
When you cast a 5th level or lower force power that deals damage or restores hit points and targets only one creature, the power can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Dynamic Attachment

## Way of Endurance
The Force manifests in myriad ways; while some use the Force to manipulate the world around them, others use it to enhance themselves. Those consulars who follow the Way of Endurance channel the Force to allow them to overcome and reflect the most grievous of injuries.
 
### Upheld by the Force
_**Way of Endurance:** 3rd level_<br>
The Force flowing through your body strengthens you, granting the following benefits:
- Your hit point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.
- Your base AC becomes 13 + your Constitution modifier. 
- When you make a melee weapon attack as a part of a force power you cast, you can use Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls.

Additionally, as an action, you can gain resistance to kinetic and energy damage for 1 minute. This effect lasts until you end it as a bonus action, you are incapacitated, or you don armor other than a shield. You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

### Retaliation Strike
_**Way of Endurance:** 6th, 9th,<br> &emsp;13th, and 17th level_<br>
You learn to turn an opponent's<br> aggression back on them. When<br> you deal damage with a force power<br> or a melee weapon attack, if you took<br> damage since the start of your last turn,<br> you deal an extra 1d6 damage. The damage<br> is the same type as the power or weapon's<br> damage.

This die increases when you reach certain levels<br> in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

### Boundless Vitality
_**Way of Endurance:** 10th level_<br>
When you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend a force point to regain health equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) as long as the damage would not reduce your hit points to 0. 

This die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d10 at 14th level, and to 1d12 at 18th level.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Unrelenting Resilience
_**Way of Endurance:** 14th level_<br>
When you use your Boundless Vitality feature while concentrating on a force power, you can add the result of the roll to the Constitution saving throw made to maintain concentration.

Additionally, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright while Upheld by the Force is active, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

### The Force Unleashed
_**Way of Endurance:** 18th level_<br>
As an action, you can choose a point within 60 feet. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of that point must make a Constitution saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 force damage and suffers 1 level of exhaustion. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and does not suffer exhaustion.

For each creature that fails this saving throw, a friendly creature within 30 feet of them can regain hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt. A friendly creature can only gain this benefit once per turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Way of Manipulation
The power of the Force is both vast and diverse, with uses varying drastically based on their wielder. Those consulars who follow the Way of Manipulation learn to control their weapons with the Force, maneuvering them across the battlefield.

### Saber Storm
_**Way of Manipulation:** 3rd, 5th, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
You learn to deftly control your weapons utilizing the Force. As an action, you can initiate your Saber Storm. When you do so, select a light- or vibro-weapon within 5 feet that is not worn or carried by a conscious creature other than you, and use the Force to cause it to levitate, acting as an extension of your will for 1 minute. When you activate this feature, you can cause the weapon to move up to 10 feet and make a melee force attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 + your forcecasting ability modifier damage. The type is of the normal damage dealt by the weapon. The weapon then returns to your side.

Your weapon moves with you, and while Saber Storm is active and you have a weapon animated, on each of your turns you can use an action to move a weapon up to 10 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. The weapon then returns to your side. Your Saber Storm ends early if you are incapacitated. At any time, you can end this feature and return the animated weapon to your hand.

Additionally, while your Saber Storm is active, and at least one animated weapon is within 5 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:
- You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1) if it doesn't already include that modifier.
- You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a power. The bonus equals your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1).

This feature can animate more than one weapon when you reach higher levels: two weapons<br> at 5th level, three weapons at 11th level,<br> and four weapons at 17th level. When<br> you use your action to attack with your<br> weapons, you can direct them at the<br> same target or at different ones. Make a<br> separate attack roll for each weapon.

At 5th level, the distance your weapon can travel increases to 20 feet. This distance increases to 30 feet at 11th level, and 40 feet at 17th level.

You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

### Deceptive Strike
_**Way of Manipulation:** 6th level_<br>
When you cast a force power with a range of touch while Saber Storm is active, your animated weapon can move up to its range and deliver the power as if it had cast it. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Guarding Weapon
_**Way of Manipulation:** 10th level_<br>
You can direct your animated weapons to absorb damage while your Saber Storm is activate. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to expend one force slot to have your animated weapon intercept it, and reduce that damage to you by an amount equal to five times the force slot's level.

### Isolate
_**Way of Manipulation:** 14th level_<br>
When you deal damage to a creature while Saber Storm is active, and that creature fails a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a force power, you can steal and redirect the power. Until the end of your next turn, either you or the creature who failed the Constitution saving throw gain the effects of the power (your choice).

### Sapping Storm 
_**Way of Manipulation:** 18th level_<br>
When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points while Saber Storm is active, you gain temporary force points equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). These temporary force points can not exceed your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice), and when you would spend a force point while you have temporary force points, the temporary force points are spent first. When Saber Storm ends, you lose any remaining temporary force points.

## Way of Negation
Some force users seek mastery over the fundamentals of energy manipulation, known as tutaminis. Those consulars who follow the Way of Negation harness this power to limit the havoc that other force-wielders might wreak.

### Force Deflection
_**Way of Negation:** 3rd level_<br>
When you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a bonus to that saving throw equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the consular table. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Power Surge
_**Way of Negation:** 6th level_<br>
You learn to simultaneously limit a creature's force powers and store that power within yourself to later strengthen your damaging force powers.

You can store a maximum number of power surges equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). Whenever you successfully end a force power with a power such as *force suppression* or *sever force*, or use your Force Shield or Force Deflection features to successfully avoid an attack or succeed on a saving throw, you gain one power surge, as you redirect the flow of the Force into yourself. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

&emsp;Once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature or object with a force power, you can spend one power surge to deal extra damage to that target. The extra damage is of the same type as the power's damage, and it equals half your consular level (rounded down).

Whenever you finish a long rest, your number of power surges resets to one. If you end a short rest with no power surges, you gain one power surge.

### Enduring Focus
_**Way of Negation:** 10th level_<br>
You can casually deflect attacks while channeling your power. While you are concentrating on a Force power, you have a +2 bonus to your AC and all saving throws.

Additionally, you can extend your Force Deflection to a creature within 5 feet of you when they fail a saving throw.

### Conflux
_**Way of Negation:** 14th level_<br>
When you use your Force Deflection feature, you can cause a ripple in the Force to expand from you. Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you each take force damage equal to half your consular level.

### Tutaminis Mastery
_**Way of Negation:** 18th level_<br>
When you use a Force-Empowered Casting option, you can spend a power surge to use it without spending additional force points.

## Way of the Seer
The Force guides us in innumerable ways, often manifesting as visions. Those consulars who follow the Way of Seer attempt to harness these visions in an attempt to work towards the best possible future, as they see it.

### Force Visions
_**Way of the Seer:** 3rd level_<br>
Glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

### Powerful Mind
_**Way of the Seer:** 6th level_<br>
You can use your force abilities to read a creature's thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature's mind to command it.

As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can't use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest. If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute. During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast the *coerce mind* force power at its base level on the creature without expending force points. The target automatically fails its saving throw against the power. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Visions of the Past
_**Way of the Seer:** 10th level_<br>
You can call up visions of the past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate surroundings. You spend at least 1 minute in meditation, then receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses of recent events. You can meditate in this way for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom score and must maintain concentration during that time, as if you were casting a force power. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Object Reading.*** Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object's previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.

***Area Reading.*** As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.

### Shielded Thoughts
_**Way of the Seer:** 14th level_<br>
Your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you do. 

### Clarity of Vision
_**Way of the Seer:** 18th level_<br>
Yhe visions in your dreamsintensify and paint a more<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;accurate picture inyour mind of what is to come.<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You roll three d20s for your Force Visions feature, rather than two.

## Way of Technology
While many Forcewielders eschew the use of technology, other choose to embrace it. Those consulars who follow the Way of Technology pair their mastery of the Force with the versatility of technology, applying the knowledge in tandem to perform unseen feats.
 
### Fundamentals of Mechu-deru
_**Way of Technology:** 3rd level_<br>
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you've dabbled in adapting your use of the Force, melding it with technology. You gain proficiency in the Technology skill, as well as simple blasters. When you cast a force power that calls for a melee weapon attack, and you are wielding a blaster with which you are proficient, you can instead make a ranged weapon attack, as long as the target is within your weapon's normal range.

Additionally, you've learned to manipulate the Force to be able to manipulate technology when it couldn't previously. When you cast a force power that could not affect droids or constructs, you can choose to have it affect droids or constructs. If it would affect multiple targets, you must expend additional uses of this feature for each additional target. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Techcasting Secrets
_**Way of Technology:** 6th, 7th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
At 6th level, you've learned to mimic technological effects. Choose two tech powers of 1st level. The chosen powers count as universal force powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the consular table.

At 7th level, you learn two additional tech powers of 1st or 2nd level. At 13th level, you learn two tech powers of 1st-3rd level, and at 17th level, you learn two tech powers of 1st-4th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tech powers you know and replace it with another tech power of the same level.

### Ionized Weave
_**Way of Technology:** 10th level_<br>
When you cast a damage-dealing force power that requires a force attack or saving throw, you can spend force points to cause that power to instead deal ion damage. The number of force points equals half the power's level (round down, minimum of one). If the power would call for a saving throw other than Dexterity, it instead calls for a Dexterity saving throw. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Force Circuitry
_**Way of Technology:** 14th level_<br>
When you use your action to cast a force power, and you use your Fundamentals of Mechu-deru feature as a part of that casting, you can use your bonus action to cast one of the tech powers you know, as long as that power has a casting time of 1 action or bonus action.

### Mechu-deru Mastery
_**Way of Technology:** 18th level_<br>
You can cast one 5th-level tech power of your choice at its base level. The power counts as a universal force power for you, and you do not require force points to cast this power. Once you've done so, you can't do so again until you complete a long rest.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/WrotCbm.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:28px;right:30px;width:523px;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(-1)' />

### Staggering Stratagem
_**Way of Telekinetics:** 3rd level_<br>
Your potency with the telekinetic power of the Force heightens. You can manipulate creatures of Large size or smaller with your force powers and Way of Telekinetics features. Additionally, once per turn, when you deal force or kinetic damage to a Large or smaller creature with a force power or class feature, you can choose to either push it up to 10 feet away from you or pull it up to 10 feet closer to you.

### Mighty Blast
_**Way of Telekinetics:** 6th, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
Your force powers batter and blast your enemies with the strength of a hurricane. When you cast a force power of 1st level or higher that deals force or kinetic damage, one creature of your choice damaged by that power must make a Strength saving throw against your universal force save DC or be knocked prone. 

This feature can affect additional creatures when you reach higher levels: two creatures at 11th<br> level and three creatures at 17th level.

### Size Matters Not
_**Way of Telekinetics:** 10th level_<br>
You can manipulate creatures of Huge size or<br> smaller with your force powers and Way of<br> Telekinetics features.

If the attacker is Huge or smaller, it must also make a Strength saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, the attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet away from you.

### My Ally is the Force
_**Way of Telekinetics:** 18th level_<br>
You can manipulate creatures of Gargantuan size or smaller with your force powers and Way of Telekinetics features.

Additionally, whenever a force power you cast pushes or pulls a creature, you can increase the distance of that push or pull by an additional 20 feet.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### You Have That Power Too
_**Way of Tutelage:** 10th, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
The bond between you and your companion has strengthened. When your companion is within 10 feet of you, and either you or your companion casts a force power that would affect only one of you, you can instead have it affect both.

Once per turn, when your companion is within 10 feet of you, and both you and your companion have to make a saving throw to resist the same effect, either you or your companion can choose to have disadvantage on the save. If either of you do so, the other of the two of you gains advantage on the save.

Additionally, when you activate this conversion to alter the properties of your lightweapon, you create a projected barrier of ion energy in a 10-foot-radius sphere around you until the start of your next turn. Hostile creatures treat this area as difficult terrain. When a hostile creature enters the shielded area or starts its turn there, that creature takes 3d4 ion damage. Any electronics not being worn or held within the barrier's radius are disabled until rebooted.

You add additional chemicals to your modified biochemist's pack. When you restore hit points with a tech power or class feature, you can use your Biochemist's Touch and Potent Mixture features.

Additionally, when you use your Invigorating Mixture to grant temporary hit points to a creature, you can choose to restore that many hit points to the same creature. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

#### Expanded Mixtures: Adhesive
You've created a new mixture from your chemicals that you can use when you activate your distributor. When you do so, the target creature must make a Strength saving throw. If the creature is Large or larger, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, a creature gains 4 slowed levels until the start of your next turn. As an action on their turn, an affected creature can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on a success. 

#### Expanded Mixtures: Blinding
You've created a new mixture from your chemicals that you can use when you activate your distributor. When you do so, the target creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature

\pagebreak

is blinded until the start of your next turn.

#### Expanded Mixtures: Hallucinogenic
You've created a new mixture from your chemicals that you can use when you activate your distributor. When you do so, the target creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies until the end of your next turn. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. 

Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target, it must choose the target at random from among the creatures it can see within range of the attack, power, or other ability it's using. If an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, the creature must make that attack if it is able to.

This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.

#### Explosive Distribution System
You upgrade your distributor, granting it the ability to create a volley. When you use your action to activate your distributor, you can choose to affect each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 30 feet.

Additionally, they are cured of any poisons or diseases that are suffering from.

#### Long-Range Distribution System
You upgrade your distributor, improving the range. When you use your action to activate your distributor, 

\columnbreak

you can choose to increase the range to 60 feet.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

#### Luminous Gel
You've added a light-emitting gel to your modified biochemist's pack. As an action, you can coat an item, object, or location up to 5-foot-square with this gel. When you do so, the gel sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The gel lasts for 1 hour before losing its potency. You can end this effect as a bonus action.

#### Oil Spill
As an action, you can cast the *oil slick* tech power without expending tech points. Casting the power in this way does not require concentration, and the oil will remain in place for the full duration of the power.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

#### Persistent Chemicals
_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_<br>
Whenever you use your Biochemist's Touch feature, you may select one creature that was damaged. At the start of each of that creature's turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage of the triggering type equal to your Intelligence modifier and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of its next turn. On a success, this feature ends, and the creature becomes immune to it for one day.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

#### Piercing Gel
_**Prerequisite:** 11th level, Luminous Gel_<br>
Your luminous gel now automatically dispels illusions and can detect invisibility, as with truesight.

#### Self-Injection Module
You install a special kolto injector into your modified biochemist's pack that can inject you with kolto in response to pain. When you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend a Hit Die to regain health as long as the damage would not reduce your hit points to 0.

#### Smart Dispersal System
When you activate your distributor, you can choose a number of creature equal to your Intelligence modifier. Those creature automatically succeed on their saving throws against your mixtures.

#### Spray Distribution System
You upgrade your distributor, granting it the ability to spray in a cone. When you use your action to activate your distributor, you can choose to affect each creature in a 15-foot cone.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

## Construction Engineering
Those engineers who choose the Construction Engineering discipline create portable, pre-built battlements that allow them to command the battlefield.

### Bonus Proficiencies
_**Construction Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in constructor's implements. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with constructor's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.

### Portable Structure
_**Construction Engineering:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
You have constructed a set of malleable, portable fortifications that can elevate you and your allies. Over the course of a long rest, you create a portable structure that travels with you. 

Your portable structure can only be directed by you, and you must have a tech focus in order to direct it remotely. If you lack a tech focus, you can instead direct it while it is within 5 feet of you. Your portable structure has the following features:
- Its AC equals your tech save DC.
- It has a number of hit points equal to 5 x your engineer level. If your structure is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses and can't be used again until you spend 1 hour repairing it, which can be done during a short or long rest.
- You can restore missing hit points to your structure by casting the *mending* tech power on it, or by completing a short or long rest. Casting the *mending* tech power restores a number of missing hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), but it can't be repaired to more than half its hit point maximum in this way. Completing a short rest restores your structure to half its hit point maximum, and completing a long rest restores it to its hit point maximum.
- Your structure has two modes: dismantled and deployed. While dismantled, your structure's speed equals your own, it hovers 5 feet off the ground, takes up the space of a 5-foot cube, and weighs 500 lbs. This increases to a 10-foot cube and 1,000 lbs. at 11th level, and a 15-foot cube and 2,000 lbs. at 17th level as you upgrade it. While deployed, your structure's speed is 0 and it takes up space dictated by how its deployed.

As an action, you can remotely deploy your structure at a space you can see on the ground within 30 feet of you, provided there is sufficient space to support it. This range increases to 60 feet at 11th level and 120 feet at 17th level. Automatic dismantling of your structure takes 1 minute, and can be initiated on your turn (no action required).

You can deploy your choice from these structures a combined total of four times, and you gain more uses at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. Each time you use this feature in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

#### Bridge
You deploy a bridge up to 30 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 3 feet thick. The bridge starts from the point at which you deploy it, and extends in a direction of your choice. When you dismantle your bridge, it retracts to the point at which you initially deployed it. Both ends of the bridge must be supported in some fashion; one end cannot be suspended in the air or on unstable terrain. The bridge can hold up to 1,000 lbs., any weight above which causes the bridge to instantly drop to 0 hit points, destroying it. If a creature is on the bridge when it is destroyed or dismantled, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful saving throw, it reaches the closest part of the bridge that has stable support, or it maintains a grip on your bridge as it retracts, as appropriate. On a failed save, it falls. 

When you reach 11th level, the bridge can now extend up to 45 feet long, 15 feet wide, and it can support up to 2,000 lbs. When you reach 17th level, the bridge can now extend up to 60 feet long, 20 feet wide, and it can support up to 4,000 lbs.

#### Cage
You create a cage that surrounds a cube up to 10 feet on each side centered on the target location. The cube is surrounded on all sides except the ground by 2-foot-thick walls. The walls and roof are completely opaque, and you choose whether the structure has a light source when you deploy it that provides bright light within the cube. Otherwise, the space within the cube is in complete darkness. The cage is permeable, allowing air, water, and sound to pass through it. You can attempt to trap unwilling Medium or smaller creatures inside the cage. When you deploy this structure in an unwilling creature's space, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, it can immediately move to nearest unoccupied space outside of the cage. Otherwise, it is trapped within the structure when it is deployed. 

When you reach 11th level, the cage can extend up to 15 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Large size or smaller. When you reach 17th level, the cage can extend up to 20 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Huge size or smaller. 

#### Shelter
You erect a shelter up to 15 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet tall, with one-foot-thick walls, a roof, and a floor. It has a single door along its walls in a location of your choice. The building has temperature control and lighting systems, and can withstand harsh winds, heavy rain and snow. Any creature inside the shelter is protected from hazardous environmental effects outside the shelter such as extreme heat or cold. The structure does not provide additional breathing air for anyone inside if the environment it is placed in is not breathable. The shelter can comfortably support up to 5 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures.

<div class='footnote'>EXPANDED CONTENT | ARCHETYPES | ENGINEER</div>

\pagebreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

&emsp;When you reach 11th level, the shelter can extend up to 30 feet long, 15 feet wide, 15 feet tall, and it can now comfortably support up to 10 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures. Additionally, when a creature completes a long rest while within your shelter, they regain all spent Hit Dice, instead of only half. When you reach 17th level, the shelter can extend up to 45 feet long, 20 feet wide, 20 feet tall, and it can now comfortably support up to 10 Large creatures. For each Large creature, it can instead support 2 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures. Additionally, when a creature completes a long rest while within your shelter, their exhaustion level is reduced by 2, instead of only 1.

#### Tower
You erect a tower from a 5-foot square platform centered on the target location that rises up to 30 feet. If the tower is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the tower. A creature can choose to fail the save. The tower comes equipped with a ladder that reaches from the ground to the platform. 

When you reach 11th level, the tower's platform can extend 5 feet by 10 feet and rise up to 40 feet. When you reach 17th level, the tower's platform can cover a 10-foot square, and rise up to 50 feet. Additionally, any creature on the tower's platform has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

#### Wall
You deploy a wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 3 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 10 feet in diameter, 10 feet high, and 3 feet thick. The wall features ramparts deep enough to support creatures of Medium size or smaller, and provides one-quarter cover to any creature on its ramparts. The wall includes a ladder on the side of your choice. You choose whether the wall contains any openings otherwise. Any openings chosen in this way can be seen through on both sides. The wall can be climbed, but requires a Strength (Athletics) check against your tech save DC for any creature without a climbing speed. A creature can only make this check once per turn. 

When you reach 11th level, the wall can deploy up to 45 feet long and 15 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 15 feet in diameter and 15 feet high. Additionally, the wall now provides half cover to any creature on its ramparts. When you reach 17th level, the wall can deploy up to 60 feet long and 20 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter and 20 feet high. Additionally, the wall now provides three-quarters cover to any creature on its ramparts.

\columnbreak

### Potent Fortifications
_**Construction Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
When a friendly creature other than you that you can see is hit with a ranged attack while within 5 feet of your deployed portable structure, you can use your reaction and expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to have your structure take the damage instead. If your structure would normally have immunity or resistance to this damage, it loses that immunity or resistance for this attack. When you do so, the damage is reduced by an amount equal to 1d10 + your Intelligence modifier + your engineer level.

### Build and Destroy
_**Construction Engineering:** 6th level_<br>
You've learned how to manipulate the weak points in structures with your technology. Your tech powers and weapon attacks gain the siege property, and your portable structures have resistance to kinetic, energy, and ion damage dealt by weapons.

### Structural Knowledge
_**Construction Engineering:** 14th level_<br>
You can spend 1 hour inspecting and looking over a structure you can see from every angle available to you and comparing it to data you have on hand. At the end of the hour, you learn the basic blueprints for the structure, including but not limited to:
- The structure's total hit points.
- Any common materials that make up the structures.
- Whether or not the structure is in use or abandoned.
- The total floor count for the structure, as well as the general purpose of each floor if it was created to suit a specific purpose.
- All non-secret entrances (including doors, windows, vents, pipe systems) and where you could find them.
- A basic map-layout of every floor and ventilation system for the building.
- The history of the building such as what company or species could have constructed it, as well as how long it's been built.
- Any structural weak points it might have.

Additionally, when you make an Investigation check while searching this structure for hidden structural elements, such as doors or passages, if you have constructor's implements, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Master Builder
_**Construction Engineering:** 18th level_<br>
Your ability with your portable structures has reached untold superiority. You gain the following benefits:
- You can have two structures active at a time, instead of only one, as you learn to more efficiently use your portable structure.
- Your structures no longer take double damage from the siege property.
- Your structures no longer automatically fail Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. Instead, your structure adds your proficiency bonus to the d20 roll when it makes one of these saving throws.

Your modified wristpad has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.

### Potent Techcasting
_**Cybertech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
When you miss with a tech attack roll, or a creature succeeds on a saving throw against a tech power you cast, you can expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to overwhelm them. Roll the die, and either add it to the attack roll or subtract it from their saving throw.

### Adaptable Applications

Each time you learn new ammunition enhancements, you can also replace one ammunition enhancement you know with a different one.

#### Amplified Shots
You have two amplified shots, which you use to activate your ammunition enhancements. An amplified shot is expended when you use it.

### Ammunition Enhancements
The ammunition enhancements are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Carbonite Shot
When this shot strikes its target, shards of carbonite wrap around the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 cold damage, it gains 1 slowed level, and it takes 2d6 kinetic damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the carbonite with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Special Ammunition save DC. Otherwise, the carbonite lasts for 1 minute or until you use this option again.

The cold damage and kinetic damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

#### Coercing Shot
You enhance your shot with chemicals that confuse the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.

The poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

#### Explosive Shot
You fire a shot set to explode on impact. The shot detonates after your attack. Immediately after the shot hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 fire damage each.

Instead, the shot shoots forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The shot passes through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.

The extra damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

#### Quell Shot
You fire a shot enhanced with a debilitating poison. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.

The poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

#### Seeking Shot
You apply a tracing signal to your shot. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The shot flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the shot to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the shot disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 kinetic damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location.

The kinetic damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

### Enhanced Shot

Each totem can be invoked to grant an effect. Once you've invoked a totem in this way, you can't do so again until you complete a short or long rest.

***Smoke.*** Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.

#### Curtain of Unyielding Wind
As an action, you call up a mighty gale, which swirls around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for 10 minutes. The wind deafens both you and other creatures in its area. It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller and hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind. The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you and the attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if the attacks pass in or out of the wind.

#### Crushing Hand of the Mountain
As an action, you can choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 30 feet. A Medium hand made from soil and stone, which lasts for 1 minute, rises in that space and reaches for one Large or smaller creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 kinetic damage and is restrained for the duration. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, which must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. To break out, the restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your focus save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand. As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.

#### Hatchling's Flame
As an action, you focus your energy into a torrent of fire that streaks away from you. A line of roaring flame 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Patient Bantha Listens
You reach out to the ground beneath you. You can use your bonus action to gain tremorsense with a range of 30 feet and a burrow speed equal to your walking speed for up to 1 minute. Your movement leaves behind a tunnel that remains for as long as this ability is active, after which it collapses.

#### Rush of the Shyrack
As an action, you form a line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide that blasts from you in a direction you choose for one minute or until you lose concentration or dismiss the effect (no action required). Each Large or smaller creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line. Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you. The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them. As a bonus action on each of your turns before the effect ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.

#### Shape the Raincloud
You can use your action pull water from air, and return it to the atmosphere. In an open container, you can create up to 20 gallons of drinkable water. You may also produce a rain that falls within a 30-foot cube and extinguishes open-air flames. You can destroy the same amount of water in an open container, or destroy a 30-foot cube of fog.

#### Swarming Ice Rabbit
As an action, you can cause a flurry of ice crystals to erupt from a point you can see within 90 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 cold damage, and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't slowed.

### Elemental Master
_**Kro Var Order:** 11th and 17th level_<br>
At 11th level, you gain one of the following features. You gain an additional option at 17th level.

You can use these features a combined number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, as shown in the monk table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 3 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 3 until you complete a long rest.

#### Earth Reaches for Sky
_**Prerequisite:** Crushing Hand of the Mountain_ <br>&emsp;or _Patient Bantha Listens_<br>
As an action, you can choose a point you can see on the ground within 120 feet. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

#### Ride the Wind
_**Prerequisite:** Curtain of Unyielding Wind_ <br>&emsp;or _Rush of the Shyrack_<br>
As an action, you can gain a flying speed equal to your movement speed for 10 minutes. You can hover while this technique is active, but when it ends, you fall if you are still aloft, unless you can stop the fall.

#### River of Hungry Flame
_**Prerequisite:** Burning Ember Flourish_ <br>&emsp;or _Hatchling's Flame_<br>
As an action, you can create a wall of fire on a solid surface within 120 feet. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for 1 minute.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

One side of the wall, chosen by you when you use this feature, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side of the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

#### Shape the Flowing River
_**Prerequisite:** Shape the Rainclud_ <br>&emsp;or _Swarming Ice Rabbit_<br>
As an action, you can control any freestanding water within 300 feet of you inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you use this feature. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.***Flood.*** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller creatures in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller creatures struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of being knocked prone. The water level remains elevated until the feature ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:16px'></div>

&emsp;***Part Water.*** You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the feature's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the feature ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.

***Redirect Flow.*** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the feature's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the feature ends or you choose a different effect.

***Whirlpool.*** This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your feature save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 kinetic damage and is caught in the vortex until the feature ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 kinetic damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.

\pagebreak

<div style='margin-top:16px'></div>

- You can use your action to create a 15-foot cube of swirling wind centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a Large or smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 10 feet away from the center of the cube.

A creature takes 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn.

At the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.

## Trickster Order
Monks of the Trickster Order embody the archetypal role of the "trickster"— one who seemingly bumbles their way into good fortune. They employ a unique fighting style composed of slips, trips, and falls to confuse and frustrate their enemies to no end. Whether your movements are actual foibles on your part or calculated strokes, they will surely leave others guessing long after your time is past.

### Bumbling Technique
_**Trickster Order:** 3rd level_<br>
Your martial arts technique mixes combat training with the precision of a dancer and the antics of a jester. When you make a Charisma (Performance) check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to half your Wisdom modifier (rounded down, minimum of +1) if it doesn't already include that modifier.

Additionally, you learn how to twist and turn quickly. Whenever you use your bonus action to make an unarmed strike, creatures you hit can't make opportunity attacks against you, and your speed increases by 10 feet until the end of your turn.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Clumsy Sway
_**Trickster Order:** 6th level_<br>
You can move in sudden, swaying ways. You gain the following benefits.

***Leap to Your Feet.*** When you're prone, you can stand up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.

***Redirect Attack.*** When a creature misses you with a melee attack roll, you can spend 1 focus point as a reaction to cause that attack to hit one creature of your choice, other than the attacker, that you can see within 5 feet of you.

### Luck of the Fool
_**Trickster Order:** 11th level_<br>
You always seem to get a lucky bounce at the right moment. When you make an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw and have disadvantage, you can spend 2 focus points to instead have advantage for that roll.

You gain the ability to make an overwhelming number of attacks against a group of enemies.

## Whills Order  
Monks of the Whills Order hold the secrets of the Force sacred, and dedicate their lives to defending ancient  knowledge of the Force and its artifacts. They master the use of ranged weapons, often crafting their own weapons in respectful admiration of the Jedi tradition of crafting lightweapons.

### Flurry of Light
_**Whills Order:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in blaster pistols, blaster rifles, ion pistols, ion rifles, and the lightbow, which are your Whills weapons and are monk weapons for you. When you are wielding a Whills weapon, you gain the following benefits:
- Your Whills weapons count as melee weapons for you, and when you make a melee weapon attack with them, you deal kinetic damage equal to your Martial Arts Damage Die.
- When you would make an unarmed strike<br> using your Martial Arts bonus action<br> or as a part of<br> your<br> Flurry of Blows, you can instead attack with a Whills weapon you are wielding. You roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your Whills weapon when attacking in this way. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the monk table.
- When you would make a ranged weapon attack with a Whills weapon, you can instead reload the weapon.

### The Force is With You

## Disabling Practice
Those operatives who choose the Disabling Practice utilize a variety of pushes, pulls, weight shifts, and joint locks to immobilize their opponent. They use these techniques to manipulate their opponent, moving them across the battlefield before incapacitating them.

### Clinch Strike
_**Disabling Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn how to discourage, debilitate, and harm your enemies. You gain the following benefits while you aren't wearing heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield:
- Your damage die for your unarmed strikes and natural weapons increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).
- You can deal Sneak Attack damage when making an unarmed strike. Additionally, you don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if the target of your Sneak Attack is a creature grappled by you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.
- You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make an unarmed strike against a creature you are grappling.

### Skilled Grappler
_**Disabling Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn a number of grappling techniques to subdue your opponents. When you hit a creature grappled by you with an unarmed strike and deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a grappling technique.

Some of your grappling techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the grappling technique's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

___

<div align="center">

**Grapple Technique save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Strength modifier

</div>

___

#### Constrict
You attempt to choke the target into unconsciousness. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be restrained until the end of your following turn.  

If you maintain this technique for 1 minute,<br> the target falls unconscious for 1 hour. Droids and constructs can not be knocked unconscious in this<br> way.

#### Disarm
You attempt to disarm a weapon or other object<br> the target is holding. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it releases the object. If you have a free hand, you can catch the object. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.

\columnbreak

<div style ='margin-top:27px'></div>

#### Hip Toss
You attempt to throw your target to the ground. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed back 5 feet, knocked prone, and stunned until the start of your next turn. This ends the grapple.

### Human Shield
_**Disabling Practice:** 9th level_<br>
You learn to manipulate the body of a grappled target to make attacks against you more difficult to land. Moving a grappled creature the same size as you or smaller no longer halves your speed, and when a creature grappled by you would grant you half cover, you instead have three-quarters cover. Additionally, when you are hit by an attack while grappling a creature, you can use your reaction to force that attack to instead hit the grappled creature.

### Kiss the Wall
_**Disabling Practice:** 13th level_<br>
You can use your surroundings to further punish the target of your grapple. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a Sneak Attack damage die for an unarmed strike you make against a creature grappled by you, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

### Neck Snap
_**Disabling Practice:** 17th level_<br>
You learn how to immediately remove your grappled opponent from the fight. As an action, you can force a creature grappled by you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, if the creature has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. If the target has more than 100 hit points, it immediately takes 10d10 true damage. 

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Lethality Practice
Those operatives who choose the Lethality Practice use disguises to get close to their enemies, then leverage the toxic power of poisons to debilitate them and capitalize on their weaknesses. 

### Bonus Proficiencies
_**Lethality Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner's kit.

### Assassinate
_**Lethality Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. Additionally, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

### Lethal Strikes
_**Lethality Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn how to read your foes and strikes their weak points. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a lethal strike. 

Some of your lethal strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the lethal strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

___

<div align="center">

**Lethal Strike save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Dexterity modifier

</div>

___

#### Priming Attack
You attempt to prime the target. The target must make a Dexterity, Constitution, or Wisdom saving throw (your choice). On a failed save, the next time you deal Sneak Attack damage against the target before the end of your next turn, you roll four additional Sneak Attack dice.

#### Target Assessment
You attempt to infer crucial details about your foe. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the GM tells you two of the following characteristics of your choice:
- Highest ability score
- Lowest ability score
- Strongest saving throw
- Weakest saving throw

#### Vulnerable Strike
You attempt to stagger the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the next time you would make an attack roll against the target before the end of your next turn, you can instead force the target to make a saving throw with the ability score of your choice. On a failed save, the creature takes normal weapon damage and you can apply your Sneak Attack dice to the roll.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Poisoner
_**Lethality Practice:** 9th level_<br>
You are a master of poisons. You can apply a poison as a bonus action, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal the application of poisons. 

Additionally, you can improve the capability of one dose of poison. To use this benefit, you must have a poisoner's kit, and the poison must be within reach. If the poison is applied before the end of your next short or long rest, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw made to resist your poison. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

### Impostor
_**Lethality Practice:** 13th level_<br>
You gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least 1 minute studying these three components of the person's behavior: listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms. If you can only study some of these aspects (such as only having writing samples, or only audio recordings), you can mimic that aspect of the person, but not other aspects you have not studied.

Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.

### Death Strike
_**Lethality Practice:** 17th level_<br>
You've become a<br> master of instant<br> death. When you<br> deal weapon<br> damage to a<br> creature that is<br> surprised, it must<br> make a Constitution<br> saving throw against<br> your lethal strike<br> save DC. On a <br>failed save, double<br> the damage of<br> your attack against<br> the creature.

## Performance Practice
Some operatives choose to master finesse and timing through performance art. Those operatives who choose the Performance Practice become skilled performers who prove especially deadly in close combat, able to find the rhythm of an attacker's strikes as easily as any song.

### Artful Dancer
_**Performance Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
Your training with music and dancing grants you certain benefits. You gain proficiency in the Performance skill and one musical instrument of your choice.

Additionally, while you are you are not wearing armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield, you can add half your Charisma modifier (rounded up) to your AC as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.

### Dazzling Steps
_**Performance Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn to conduct impressive displays of grace and speed in combat. While you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield, and you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a weapon with either the light or finesse properties, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, and if you deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a dazzling step.

Some of your dazzling steps require your target to make a saving throw to resist the dazzling step's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

___

<div align="center">

**Dazzling Step save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Charisma modifier

</div>

___

#### Defensive Step
You defend yourself from further attack. Roll two Sneak Attack dice. You gain temporary hit points that last until the start of your next turn equal to the amount rolled.

#### Mobile Step
You twist and twirl around the target. The target must make a Strength saving throw. A Huge or larger creature automatically succeeds. On a failed save, it is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately move into the space it just vacated without provoking opportunity attacks.

#### Offensive Step
Choose another creature that you can see<br> within your reach. The creature must make a<br> Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, roll<br> two Sneak Attack dice. The creature takes<br> damage equal to the amount rolled. This<br> damage is of the same as your weapon's<br> damage.

### Flexible Body
_**Performance Practice:** 9th level_<br>
You are able to use your acrobatic talent to gain the upper hand in combat. You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to shove or trip a creature. When you do so, you can make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check instead of a Strength (Athletics) check. 

Additionally, you now ignore difficult terrain, you can move through space occupied by hostile creatures, and you can squeeze through smaller spaces without expending extra movement.

### Dance of Death
_**Performance Practice:** 13th level_<br>
You can use your action to make a weapon attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. You can choose to deal Sneak Attack damage to each creature you hit, but you can only roll half your number of Sneak Attack dice (rounded up) per creature.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Master of Dance
_**Performance Practice:** 17th level_<br>
Your confidence when putting on a show has extended into combat. You add your Charisma modifier to initiative checks.

### Tools of the Trade
_**Pugnacity Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You've learned to move swiftly while wielding larger armaments. You gain proficiency with medium armor and martial vibroweapons. If you are already proficient in medium armor, you instead gain proficiency in heavy armor. Additionally, you can deal Sneak Attack damage with any weapon, as long as it does not have the heavy or special properties.

Lastly, you don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if no creature other than your target is within 5 feet of you, as long as the target of the attack is below its hit point maximum. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.

### Blitz Attack
_**Pugnacity Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You've learned ways to use your martial ability to boost your combat performance. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a blitz attack.

Some of your blitz attacks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the attack's effects. The saving throw DC is as follows:

___

<div align="center">

**Blitz Attack save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

</div>

___

#### Demoralizing Attack
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

#### Diverting Attack
Roll two of your Sneak Attack dice. The first time the target would deal damage before the start of your next turn, that damage is reduced by an amount equal to the resulting roll.

#### Warmonger's Attack
If the target makes an attack against you or an allied creature within 5 feet of you before the start of your next turn, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against it.

### Extra Attack
_**Pugnacity Practice:** 9th level_<br>
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can choose to attack twice, instead of once. Additionally, you can deal Sneak Attack damage any number of times on your turn. Each time you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can choose how many Sneak Attack dice you apply. You can't apply more than your total Sneak Attack dice each turn.

\columnbreak

<div style ='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Unrelenting Advance
_**Pugnacity Practice:** 13th level_<br>
You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws against effects that would grapple or restrain you. Additionally, if you are grappled or restrained, and you could use your action to attempt to end the effect, you can instead use your bonus action.

### Razor Focus
_**Pugnacity Practice:** 17th level_<br>
You can enter a hyper-focused state of mind for 1 minute as a bonus action. You must maintain concentration, as if concentrating on a power. For the duration, each time you successfully deal Sneak Attack damage against a creature, you gain two additional Sneak Attack dice, cumulatively, as your attacks become increasingly precise. These additional dice are lost when your focus ends, whether through failing to maintain concentration or after 1 minute.

The first time you use this feature, you suffer no ill effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you suffer one level of exhaustion each time you use it.

## Ruffian Practice
Those operatives who choose the Ruffian Practice use rough-and-tumble tactics to handle any fight, big or small. They incite chaos and make devious moves that keep their enemies reeling.

### Rakish Audacity
_**Ruffian Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
Your unmistakable confidence propels you into battle. You can add your Charisma modifier to your initiative rolls.

Additionally, you don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if no creature other than your target is within 5 feet of you, as long as the target of the attack is within 5 feet of you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.

Finally, during your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.

### Nimble Step
_**Ruffian Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn to fluidly strike and maneuver through combat. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to maneuver across the battlefield.

Some of your fancy footworks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the debilitating strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

___

<div align="center">

**Nimble Step save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Dexterity modifier.

</div>

___

#### Blade Defense
You attempt to determine your target's next strike. Roll two Sneak Attack dice, and the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your AC increases by the higher amount rolled on the dice against the first attack it makes against you before the start of your next turn. On a successful save, your AC instead increases by the lower amount.

#### Disarming Strike
You attempt to disarm a creature with your attack. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. If you have a free hand, you can catch the item. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.

#### Fancy Footwork
Roll two Sneak Attack dice. Your speed increases by 5 x the greater result of the two dice, and you ignore difficult terrain until the end of your current turn.

### Panache
_**Ruffian Practice:** 9th level_<br>
Your charm becomes extraordinarily beguiling. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

&emsp;If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can't make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a power, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart.

If you succeed on the check and the creature isn't hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.

### Elegant Maneuver
_**Ruffian Practice:** 13th level_<br>
You can use a bonus action on your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during the same turn.

### Master Duelist
_**Ruffian Practice:** 17th level_<br>
Your mastery of the blade lets you turn failure into success in combat. If you miss with an attack roll, you can roll it again with advantage. Once you do so, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Tracker Droid Companion
_**Saboteur Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn to employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to create and customize your own  tracker droid companion.

Create your tracker droid companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. You must have astrotech's implements in order to create your droid.

In addition to its traits and features, your tracker droid companion gains an additional benefit while it is bonded to you:
- Your tracker droid gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each droid trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of droid traits equal to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded up, minimum of one).

Lastly, when you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher that would affect only one target, and your tracker droid companion is bonded and within 10 feet of you or your target, your tracker droid companion can use its reaction to increase the level at which you are casting your power by 1. This feature can increase a power's level above your Max Power Level, and using this feature does not cost additional tech points.

At 11th level, your tracker droid companion must be within 30 feet of you or your target to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your tracker droid companion must be within 60 feet.

You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Ion Pulse
_**Saboteur Practice:** 13th level_<br>
As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one or more of your tracker droid's Hit Dice to have it emit an pulse of ion energy. Each creature within 5 feet of your tracker droid must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. A creature takes ion damage for each Hit Die expended in this way on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. The size of the damage die equals the size of your tracker droid's Hit Die. Any electronics not being worn or carried within the blast radius are disabled until rebooted.

### Sabotage
_**Saboteur Practice:** 17th level_<br>
You gain the ability to sabotage a tech power in the process of being cast. When a hostile creature casts a tech power, and you are the target of the tech power or within its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make an Intelligence saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, the power is cast as normal.

On a failed save, you negate the power's effects, and the caster takes 1d6 lightning damage per level of the power it was casting. Additionally, on a failed save, the caster's tech focus used to cast the tech power is overloaded and can't be used to cast tech powers for 1 minute. 

At the end of each of the caster's turns, it can repeat the Intelligence saving throw. On a success, it can use the tech focus to cast tech powers again.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Swift Surgery
_**Sawbones Practice:** 9th level_<br>
You know how to quickly patch up wounds, given the right tools. You are able to use a traumakit or administer a medpac as a bonus action, and when you use a traumakit to stabilize a dying creature, that creature also regains a number of hitpoints equal to your Intelligence modifier.

### Dosage Control
_**Sawbones Practice:** 13th level_<br>
Your knowledge of medicine allows you to partition and ration healing supplies very effectively, without impacting its potency. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a rest, you can carefully measure and mark out dosages of a medpac within reach. The medpac can now be used twice before it is consumed.

At your DM's discretion, you may be able to use this feature on other pacs, stims, or adrenals, most likely involving an ability check to succeed.

### Self-Sustain
_**Sawbones Practice:** 17th level_<br>
You have advantage on death saving throws.

_**Scrapper Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn to user underhanded tactics to gain the upper hand. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to perform an upper hand technique.

## Archaeologist Pursuit
Archaeologists are those who study the remnants of historical civilizations. Those scholars who choose the Archaeologist Pursuit are driven by a desire to uncover the past, forming a connection to the lives of those that came before, and unlocking within themselves a connection not just to history, but to the Force itself.

\columnbreak

#### Force Powers Known
You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Archaeologist Pursuit Forcecasting table.

#### Force Points
You have a number of force points equal to your scholar level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Archaeologist Pursuit Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice).

Additionally, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

### Archaic Diagnostics
_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 3rd level_<br>

### Additional Maneuvers
_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain access to new maneuvers which reflect the progress of your studies into ancient civilizations. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.

#### Force Resonance
Immediately after you deal damage to a target with a force attack, you can expend a superiority die and target a second creature that you can see within 30 feet of the first creature. Roll the die, and the second creature takes force damage equal to the roll + your forcecasting modifier. 

#### Fortune and Glory 
When you would make a weapon attack against a target within 30 feet, you can instead manipulate the Force to expend a superiority die and make a Sleight of Hand check using your universal forcecasting ability to plant something on the target, conceal an object on the target, lift the target's purse, or take something from its pocket. Roll the superiority die, and add the result to the check.

#### Fossil Fueled
When you would spend force points to cast a force power, you can instead expend a superiority die to cast the power. When you do so, you take true damage equal to the number rolled + your universal forcecasting modifier + twice the power's level. 

For each additional time you use this maneuver without taking a short or long rest, roll an additional superiority die of damage.

#### One with the Force
Once per turn, when you make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a force power, you can expend a superiority die and add the number rolled to the saving throw.

#### Overwhelming Wit
Once per round, when a creature succeeds on a force power you cast or your class feature that requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw, you can expend a superiority die to make a universal forcecasting ability check with proficiency, substituting the result of the roll for the save DC for that power.

#### Mind over Midichlorians
When you are forced to make a saving throw against a force power or effect you can see, you can expend a superiority die to change the saving throw to an Intelligence saving throw.

### Force Carving
_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 6th level_<br>
You have unlocked more control over the Force, allowing you to choose wisely who it affects. When you cast a force power that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number 

<div class='footnote'>EXPANDED CONTENT | ARCHETYPES | SCHOLAR</div>

\pagebreak

<div style='margin-top:16px'></div>

of them equal to 1 + the power's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the power, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

### Psychometric Analysis
_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 9th level_<br>
Your strength in the Force and your ability to read the objects around you intensifies. You can use your Critical Analysis to analyze an object of Huge size or smaller that you can see within range. When you do so, you learn whether or not the object is enhanced, cursed, and how old it is. 

Additionally, you can end your Critical Analysis on the object (no action required) to ask it a single question and receive an answer, usually in the form of an auditory or visual hallucination.

### Voodoo Doll
_**Occultist Pursuit:** 9th level_<br>
Over the course of an hour, which can be done during a short rest, you can perform a ritual to construct an effigy of a creature. In order to do so, you must have at least heard of or seen the creature before, and the target must be in the same system as you. At the end of the hour, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. This saving throw is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it, as shown in the Knowledge Save Modifier and Connection Save Modifier tables below. 

##### Knowledge Save Modifier

|Likeness or picture |-2|
|Curse of Objurgation |-3|

On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this ritual against it again for 24 hours. On a failed save, the ritual creates a Tiny doll that is linked to the target. The doll remains linked for 24 hours, or for 10 minutes after you first use it. It disintegrates at the end of this duration. For the duration, you can see and hear the target through the doll as if you were within 5 feet of the creature.

Additionally, as action while the doll is in your possession, you can expend a Hit Die to torment the target, choosing an effect from the following options:

- **Stab:** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or gain 2 slowed levels and fall prone. The slowed levels effect lasts for 1 hour.

If the original attack roll would hit the second creature(s), it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die.

The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

#### Precision Attack
When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.

#### Return Fire
When a creature misses you with a ranged attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a ranged weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

### Shoot First
_**Deadeye Technique:** 11th level_<br>
You have learned that the person who shoots first is often the one who walks out alive. When you make a ranged weapon attack against a creature that has not yet acted during your first turn in combat and you have advantage on the roll, you can reroll one of the dice once.

Additionally, on a hit, you deal an extra 1d6 damage of the same type as the weapon.

### Overwatch
_**Deadeye Technique:** 15th level_<br>

## Illusionist Technique
Among the galaxy you may find the various infiltrators and agents who make ample use of holographic technology to get themselves in and out of danger. Followers of the Illusionist Technique make use of this holographic technology to give themselves an illusory edge in combat.

### Holographic Decoy
_**Illusionist Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
As an action, you can create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 10 minutes, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a power). The decoy appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. The decoy is purely visual. If anything passes through it, it is revealed to be an illusion. For the duration, you can cast tech powers as though you were in the decoy's space. Both your decoy and the target of your tech power must be within your line of sight.

You can use your bonus action to cause the decoy to move up to 30 feet. As your decoy changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the decoy. If your decoy is ever more than 120 feet away from you, it immediately disappears.

Additionally, when both you and your decoy are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the decoy, but is not aware it is an illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature.

A creature that uses its action to examine your decoy can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. 

\columnbreak

The target of your Ranger's Quarry feature has disadvantage on all checks made to discern the nature of your illusions. Additionally, when the target of your Ranger's Quarry is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to immediately cause an active illusion, or your Holographic Decoy, to take the form of the creature as long as the creature's dimensions fall within the power's capacity restrictions.

### Charged Illusions
_**Illusionist Technique:** 7th level_<br>
When a creature discerns the nature of an illusion you have created using a tech power or class feature while within 5 feet of it, you can dispel the illusion (no action required) to have the creature take energy damage equal to 1d10 + half your scout level (rounded down). 

### Quick Escape
_**Illusionist Technique:** 11th level_<br>

### Improved Decoys
_**Illusionist Technique:** 15th level_<br>
You can create up to four duplicates of yourself, instead of one, when you use your Holographic Decoy feature. When you use your bonus action to move a decoy, you can move any number of them with the same bonus action.

You can use Intelligence instead of Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls made with weapons with the finesse property or blaster weapons against the target of your Ranger's Quarry.

Additionally, once per round, when you hit the target of your Ranger's Quarry with a tech attack, or it fails a saving throw against a tech power you cast that deals damage, you can deal additional damage equal to your Ranger's Quarry damage die of the same type as the tech power's damage.

### Adaptive Techie
_**Mastermind Technique:** 7th level_<br>
When you complete a long rest, you can choose up to a number of tech powers you know equal to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded down) and replace them with another tech power, as long as that power is not of a higher level than your Max Power Level.

### Emergency Planning
_**Mastermind Technique:** 11th level_<br>
You've learned to formulate and execute a plan. As an action, you can choose up to six creatures (including yourself) that you can see within 60 feet of you. For each creature, choose one of the following: ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Each creature gains an Emergency Planning die, which is a d8.

Once within the next 10 minutes, each creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, as determined when you use this feature.

## Teleportation Technique
&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether through experimentation or discovery of<br> &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an ancient technology, followers of the<br> &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teleportation Technique have learned to create<br> &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brief teleportation portals, allowing them to<br> &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maneuver and attack both quickly and<br> &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unpredictably throughout the battlefield.

### Bonus Proficiencies
_**Teleportation Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in tinker's implements.

### Personal Teleporter
_**Teleportation Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
You can use portable teleporters as a bonus action, instead of an action. 

Additionally, while you are wielding a tech focus, you can use your bonus action to create a pair of linked portals: one portal appears in a space within 5 feet of you, and the other portal appears in an unoccupied space you can see up to 30 feet away. These portals last until the start of your next turn, and they are large enough to accommodate Medium and smaller creatures and objects. Portals take the appearance of an elongated, shimmering mirror, and looking through a portal, a creature can see through the linked portal as if looking through a window. A creature or object who passes through a portal immediately appears in a space within 5 feet of the linked portal. You can use your reaction to end your portals early. If a creature is partially within your portals, it is shunted back to the space it previously occupied and it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your a tech save DC. On a failed save, it takes energy damage equal to your scout level + your Intelligence modifier.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest. At the beginning of each of your turns while you have a pair of portals active, you can expend a use of this feature to extend the duration of the portals until the start of your next turn (no action required).

The distance at which you can create portals increases at higher levels. It increases to 60 feet at 5th level, 90 feet at 9th level, 150 feet at 13th level, 300 feet at 17th level, and 1,000 feet at 20th level.

### Mark of the Teleporter
_**Teleportation Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
On your turn, when you deal damage to the target of your Ranger's Quarry, and either you, your weapon, or the source of your damage have passed through your portals on this turn, when you roll below half the maximum on a damage die, you can treat the roll as if you'd rolled half the maximum on the damage die. You can only affect a number of dice up to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded up, minimum of one) in this way.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Residual Warp
_**Teleportation Technique:** 7th level_<br>
When you use your Personal Teleporter feature, you can place your portal in a place you've visited in the last 10 minutes, provided you can remember it, as opposed to a place you can see. That place must still be within range of your teleporter.

### Quantum Entanglement
_**Teleportation Technique:** 11th level_<br>
When you use your Personal Teleporter feature, you can place the portal that you would normally place within 5 feet of you in a place you can see within your Personal Teleporter's range. If that space is occupied by a Huge or smaller creature or a Medium or smaller unsecured object, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. An object automatically fails this saving throw, and a creature can choose to fail. On a failed save, a Medium or smaller creature or object falls through the portal, immediately appearing in a space within 5 feet of the linked portal and falling prone. A Large or Huge creature instead falls prone without moving.

### Reprisal
_**Teleportation Technique:** 15th level_<br>
When you would be affected by a weapon or tech power that requires a Dexterity saving throw or attack roll and would affect only you, you can use your reaction to instantaneously create a pair of portals to redirect that power to another target within 30 feet. If the weapon or power required a melee or ranged attack roll, make a melee or ranged tech attack roll against the new target, as appropriate. If it required a Dexterity saving throw, the new target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Path of Communion
Those who master the Force can transcend death, persisting beyond their natural experation. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Communion bond with a Force ghost, developing a symbiotic relationship which alters the way they perceive their surroundings.

### Mystical Connection
_**Path of Communion:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn the *feedback* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and the target fails its saving throw. Finally, when you deal psychic damage with the *feedback* force power, you deal additional psychic damage equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) if it doesn't already include that modifier.

### Symbiot Spirit
_**Path of Communion:** 3rd level_<br>
You attract the attention of the spirit of a Force ghost. Over the course of one hour, you can attune to the spirit, forging a lasting connection. While attuned to a spirit, you gain the following benefits:
- Your spirit is always audible and visible to you. Your spirit can choose to make itself audible and visible or inaudible and invisible to other creatures (no action required), but it is always visible to beings with truesight.
- Your spirit can not interact with the corporeal world, but it is also not impeded by unenhanced walls or barriers.
- Your spirit acts independently of you, and it only obeys your commands if it chooses to. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. Your spirit can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
- While your spirit is within 100 feet of you, you can telepathically communicate with it. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your spirit's vision and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.
- When you cast a force power with a range of touch, your spirit can deliver the power as if it had cast it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the power when you cast it. If the power requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

You can only attune to one spirit at a time. If you attempt to attune to another spirit, you immediately break the bond with your current spirit.

> #### Generating Your Spirit
> Your spirit might be the ghost of a benevolent Jedi, discovered in the ruins of a Jedi temple, or a powerful Sith spirit lingering in an ancient artifact. It might be the spirit of a Nightsister sorceress, or a paragon of a long-forgotten monastic order. Work with your GM to determine the nature of your spirit.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

&emsp;Additionally, your spirit can briefly interact with the physical world. When you would make a melee attack, your spirit can deliver the attack as if it had made it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the attack. It uses your modifiers for the attack and damage rolls. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

### Invasive Presence
_**Path of Communion:** 7th level_<br>
Your spirit can invade another creature's being. As an action, your spirit can touch a creature within 5 feet of it, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw. 

On a failed save, your spirit moves into that creatures space, inhabiting its body, for 1 minute. The affected creature has disadvantage on the first attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes each turn. At the end of each its turns, the creature repeats this save. On a success, it repels the spirit from its body, and it becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

### Ethereal Vision
_**Path of Communion:** 13th level_<br>
You and your guiding spirit both gain truesight out to 60 feet as long as your spirit is within 100 feet of you.

Additionally, when you use your action to see through your spirit's senses, you are no longer deaf and blind with regard to your own senses, able to comprehend what happens in both perspectives simultaneously.

### Assuming Direct Control
_**Path of Communion:** 18th level_<br>
When a creature fails its saving throw against your Invasive Presence feature, the target becomes charmed by you for as long as Invasive Presence is active.

While the target is charmed, you and your spirit have a telepathic link with it as long as you are within 100 feet of it. You and your spirit can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

## Path of the Corsair
There may come a time when a sentinel finds themselves stranded, hunted, or in any situation where they must hide their nature as a force wielder. Those sentinels who follow the Path of the Corsair make use of alternative weaponry not commonly associated with force-wielders to great effect.

### Scavenger's Reach
_**Path of the Corsair:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn the *force disarm* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and the target fails its save. Finally, when you cast the *force disarm* power, disarm a blaster weapon, and catch it, you can reload the weapon as a part of the same action.

### Corsair Weapons
_**Path of the Corsair:** 3rd level_<br>
You can use the force to quickly learn the use of unfamiliar weapons. When you hold a weapon that you are not proficient in, you can spend 1 force point (no action required) to gain proficiency with that weapon until the end of your next long rest. Additionally, you can use your Force-Empowered Self options when you hit with a ranged weapon attack.

Lastly, when you throw a grenade, you can use Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength when determining your throwing range.

### Force-Empowered Detonators
_**Path of the Corsair:** 7th level_<br>
You learn to infuse a number of small detonators with the Force. Over the course of a short or long rest, you can create a number of detonators equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). Your detonators can only be used by you, and they lose their potency at the end of your next short or long rest.

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can throw one of your detonators at a point within range. Your detonators have a range equal to 30 feet + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier x 5. Make a universal ranged force attack. On a hit, the detonator adheres to the target, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is pushed back 5 feet. On a miss, it falls to the ground. Hit or miss, the detonator then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw against your universal force save DC. If the detonator adhered to a target, the creature has disadvantage on the saving throw. A creature takes force damage using your Kinetic Combat die + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Energized Kinetics
_**Path of the Corsair:** 13th level_<br>
Once per turn, when you deal damage with a Force-Empowered Detonator or your Double Strike feature, you can deal additional damage using your Kinetic Combat die. The damage type is force, lightning, necrotic, or psychic (your choice).

### Disorienting Detonations
_**Path of the Corsair:** 18th level_<br>
When a creature fails the saving throw against your Force-Empowered Detonators feature, you can spend 2 force points to subject it to the effects of one of the following force powers: *affliction, force blind/deafen, stun,* or *stun droid*. They automatically fail the saving throw for the selected power, but the effects only last until the end of your next turn.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/GSI1y6J.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:28px;right:35px;width:400px;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(-1)' />

## Path of Ethereality
In the distant reaches of the galaxy obscure knowledge and forgotten secrets of the Force can sometimes be found. While other Force-sensitive may find themselves touched by this secret knowledge of the Force, those sentinels who follow the Path of Ethereality instead find themselves grabbed. Held onto by mysterious aspects of the Force that refuse to let go, these sentinels find themselves able to manipulate the universe around them.

### Aberrant Resilience
_**Path of Ethereality:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn the *resistance* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use your Deflection and Slow Time Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action. Finally, this power no longer requires concentration for you when you target yourself with it.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Force-Empowered Kinesis
_**Path of Ethereality:** 3rd level_<br>
Your connection to the Force allows you to briefly become incorporeal. When you use a Force-Empowered Self option, until the end of your turn, you can move through other creatures and objects as if they are difficult terrain. If you end this movement inside a solid object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take true damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved. 

### Out of Touch
_**Path of Ethereality:** 7th level_<br>
As an action, you can step out of sync with the rest of the universe for 1 minute. At the start of each of your turns, roll a d20. If you roll 11 or higher, you and everything your are wearing or carrying are completely invisible to all beings, except for those with truesight. On a roll of 10 or lower, you instead appear as an indistinguishably blurred form roughly your normal height and weight, though a being with truesight sees you normally. Regardless of your appearance, for the duration, your speed doubles, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you can move through creatures and objects willingly though you can not affect them and they can not affect you. You can end this feature early on your turn (no action required). When this effect ends, if you are inside a solid object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved. 

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Path of Synthesis
There is power in diversity unknown to those of narrow mind. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Synthesis blend their intricate mastery of the Force with their understanding of technology, creating unique effects to overcome their obstacles.

### Techcasting Secrets
_**Path of Synthesis:** 3rd level_<br>
You have learned to intersperse your training with an aptitude for technology. Choose two tech powers of 1st level or lower. The chosen powers count as universal force powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the sentinel table. 

At 7th level, you learn two tech powers of 2nd level or lower. At 13th level, you learn two tech powers of 3rd level or lower. At 17th level, you learn two tech powers of 4th level or lower. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tech powers you know and replace it with another tech power of no higher than the level determined by this feature.

### Synthetic Understanding
_**Path of Synthesis:** 3rd level_<br>
You've applied your newfound knowledge to broader pursuits. You gain proficiency in Technology or one tool of your choice.

Additionally, when you make an Intelligence (Technology) check, or a check with a tool, you may use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) instead of your Intelligence modifier.

Finally, when you deal damage with a tech power or your Double Strike Force Empowered Self option, you can choose to substitute the damage dealt as ion.

### Force-Empowered Tech
_**Path of Synthesis:** 7th level_<br>
You learn to fully blend your technological aptitude with your use of the Force. You have three such effects: Disruption Pulse, Force Override, and Techcasting Insight. When you use your Force-Empowered Tech, you choose which effect to create.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Disruption Pulse
As an action, you can send out a 30 foot cone of electromagnetically-charged energy to overload enemy weapons. Each creature within the cone that is wearing or carrying a weapon with electric components must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the weapon is being worn, this save is made with disadvantage. On a failed save, the first attack they attempt to make with that weapon has disadvantage. A creature with multiple weapons must make a separate save for each weapon.

#### Forced Override
When you cast a tech power that requires a saving throw, you can impose disadvantage on the save (no action required).

#### Techcasting Insight
As an action, you can attempt to determine another creature's experience with techcasting. When you do so, you make an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Technology) check. If you succeed, you immediately learn the target's techcasting Max Power Level, as well as any tech powers currently affecting the target.

### Improved Force-Empowered Tech
_**Path of Synthesis:** 13th level_<br>
You've gained access to two additional Force-Empowered Tech effects: Harmonic Synthesis and Conservation of Energy.

#### Harmonic Synthesis
When you use your action to cast a force power, you can use your bonus action to gain resistance to damage dealt by tech powers until the start of your next turn. If you use your action to cast a tech power, you can instead gain resistance to damage dealt by force powers.

#### Conservation of Energy
When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a tech power, you can reduce the force point cost of the tech power to 0 (no action required).

### Reflective Shield
_**Path of Synthesis:** 18th level_<br>
When you use your Force-Empowered Tech features, a barrier for energy shimmers into existence, surrounding you until the end of your next turn. When you take damage, you can mitigate the<br> incoming energy and potentially<br> reflect it back at your attacker.<br> You use your reaction to<br> have resistance<br> against the<br> triggering<br> damage, and<br> if the source of the<br> damage is within 5<br> feet of you, they take<br> half of the total damage<br> dealt as ion.

## Path of Tenacity
The tenacious are ever mindful that the Force ebbs and flows, and uses this knowledge to great advantage.

### Protector
_**Path of Tenacity:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn the *saber ward* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use your Deflection and Slow Time Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action.

The creatures immediately lose this benefit if they move more than 5 feet away from you.

### Kinetic Ward
_**Path of Tenacity:** 3rd level_<br>
You can use your reaction to deflect a strike when you are dealt damage by a melee weapon attack. When you<br><br><br><br> do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your sentinel level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can redirect it at another target if you have a weapon capable of doing so. You can spend 1 force point to make a melee weapon attack at a target within 5 feet of you with the weapon, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and if the attack hits it uses your Kinetic Combat die for its damage roll. If *saber ward* is active, you have advantage on the attack roll.

### Kinetic Bulwark
_**Path of Tenacity:** 7th level_<br>
You can extend your Kinetic Ward to a creature within 5 feet of you when they are hit by a melee weapon attack. If this damage is not reduced to 0, the warded creature takes any remaining damage. 

### Indomitable
_**Path of Tenacity:** 13th level_<br>
The Force flowing through you makes it harder for movement to be forced upon you. You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to avoid being grappled or moved. If you fail the saving throw or ability check, you can spend 1 force point to reroll one of the dice once. You must use the new roll.

Additionally, if allies within 5 feet of you are gaining the benefit of your *saber ward* force power, they also gain the benefit of this feature.

### Kinetic Bastion
