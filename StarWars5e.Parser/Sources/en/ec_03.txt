## Addicted Approach
For some, the consumption of substances is the entirety of their life. For berserkers of the Addicted Approach, substances cause their fury to burn stronger and deeper, granting significant benefits.

### Slythmonger Savvy
When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in your choice of brewer's kit or spicer's kit. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid the low or addiction to substances. Lastly, you can consume substances as a bonus action, and when you do so, you can also enter a rage as a part of this same bonus action.

### Freedom Through Slavery
Also at 3rd level, while you are raging or experiencing the high of a substance, you have advantage on saving throws that would force you to act against your will, be frightened, or prevent you from attacking a creature. If you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, you are instead immune to effects that would force you to act against your will or would prevent you from attacking a creature.

### Release the Beast
At 6th level, while you are raging or experiencing the high of a substance, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a Hit Die to deal additional damage to the target. Roll the Hit Die, adding the result of the die to the damage roll. If you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, you also add your Constitution modifier to the damage roll.

### Seeing Sound
Starting at 10th level, while you are raging or experiencing the high of a substance, you have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. If you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, you instead have blindsight with a range of 30 feet. If you would already have blindsight, it instead increases by 5 feet or 15 feet, respectively.

### Fuel the Rampage
At 14th level, while you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, having 0 hit points doesn't knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don't die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.

## Bloodstorm Approach
The Bloodstorm Approach is said to have originated from the ancient wookiee Hroufrasnooohn clan (which loosely translates to Bloodstorm in Galactic Basic), whose warriors performed gravity-defying feats with their flying vibroaxes through a combination of unorthodox techniques and a mystical belief in their own abilities. A berserker who follows this approach can hurl their devastating weapons at enemies with such power and skill that it completely blurs the line between melee and ranged combat.

### Furious Throw
When you choose this approach at 3rd level, your throwing techniques have become a perfect extension of your melee prowess. You may count your thrown weapon attacks as if they were melee weapon attacks for the purposes of your class features and feats, such as your Berserker Rage and Reckless Attack abilities.

### Returning Attacks
Also at 3rd level, any weapon you throw can ricochet back to you at your command. When you make a thrown weapon attack, you may have the weapon fly back to your hand immediately after the attack.

### Throw Anything
At 6th level, your strength and mastery of throwing techniques has allowed you to throw vibroaxes as easily as others hurl vibrodaggers. When you are wielding a melee weapon that you have proficiency with, it gains the thrown property (range 20/60).

### Fling People
Starting at 10th level, you learn to throw creatures as easily as you throw your weapons. When you successfully grapple a creature, you may<br> immediately throw the creature:

#### Throw Friend
If the creature is a willing ally and volunteers<br> to be grappled, you throw the target into any unoccupied space within 60 feet. That creature<br> may immediately use its reaction to make one<br> melee weapon attack, adding your Strength<br> modifier to the attack's damage roll.

#### Throw Foe
If the creature is an opponent, you throw the target into any unoccupied space within 30 feet, where it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier and falls prone.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Raging Whirlwind
At 14th level, you can send your weapon spinning into a gravity-defying whirlwind of pain. Once per rage as an action, you may throw a weapon with the thrown property to a point you choose within 60 feet. The weapon fills the air as a cyclone in a 10 foot radius sphere centered on that point. A creature takes damage equal to the thrown weapon's damage + your Strength modifier + your Rage Damage when it enter's the whirlwind's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. This effect ends when you command the weapon to return to you as a free action or your rage ends.

## Brawling Approach
Most berserkers require weapons. For berserkers of the Brawling Approach, however, everything is their weapon.

### Fists of Fury
When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you've learned to hone your rage through your fists. Your unarmed strike damage increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).

### Reckless Strikes
Also at 3rd level, while you are raging, not wearing heavy armor, and not wielding a shield, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon, you can choose to forgo your rage damage to make the attack a reckless strike.

Some of your reckless strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the reckless strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**Reckless Strike save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Strength modifier

</div>

___

#### Bracing Strike
You gain temporary hit points equal to your rage damage bonus. If the target is grappled by you, you instead gain temporary hit points equal to twice your rage damage bonus.

#### Punishing Strike
Your target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is deafened until the start of its next turn. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead incapacitated until the start of its next turn.

#### Staggering Strike
Your target must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (the target chooses the ability score to use). On a failed save, your target is pushed back 5 feet. If the target is grappled by you, it instead knocked prone.

### Shattering Strikes
At 6th level, your rage causes your strikes to overcome the hardest of materials. While raging, you gain the following benefits:
- Your unarmed strikes and improved weapons count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.
- Your unarmed strikes deal double damage against structures.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Stop Hitting Eachother
Starting at 10th level, you can grapple creatures two sizes larger than you, instead of one. 

Additionally, you can use creatures you have grappled that are at least one size smaller than you as improvised weapons. When you do so, when you hit with an attack using a creature as a weapon, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. While raging, you can instead use creatures your size or smaller as improvised weapons.

### Enforcer
At 14th level, when you would make an unarmed strike or attack with an improvised weapon with advantage, you can choose to forgo the advantage. If you do so, your critical hit range increases by 1 for that attack, and on a hit, you deal maximum damage instead of rolling.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/EJ7lAHo.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:24px;right:90px;width:275px;z-index:1000' />

\pagebreak

## Cyclone Approach
The Cyclone Approach empowers the berserker's ability to fight with weapons in each hand. Followers of this approach learn to move quickly to avoid attacks and can become a whirlwind of fury and steel, cleaving through hordes of enemies.

### Dual Wielder
When you choose this approach at 3rd level, when you engage in Two-Weapon Fighting, you can add your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) to the damage of your Two-Weapon Fighting attack as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.

### Double Swing
Also at 3rd level, once on each of your turns when you miss with an attack while raging, you can immediately make a melee attack with the weapon in your other hand. 

### Twisting Winds
At 6th level, your unpredictable movement makes you harder to hit and pin down. When you make a saving throw or ability checks to avoid being knocked prone, pushed, grappled, or restrained, it gains a bonus equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Mighty Leap
Starting at 10th level, the distance you can jump is doubled, and you do not provoke attacks of opportunity if you leave a hostile creature's reach while jumping.

### Tornado
At 14th level, you can become a tornado of attacks. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your regular attacks to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. If you are wielding a separate melee weapon in each hand, each successful hit against a target deals damage equal to the damage dice of both weapons + your ability modifier + any other modifiers.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/N7AJIeU.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:-116px;right:-15px;width:835px;z-index:1000;' />

<div class='footnote'>EXPANDED CONTENT | ARCHETYPES | BERSERKER</div>

\pagebreak

## Frenzied Approach
For some berserkers, rage is a means to an end—that end being violence. The Frenzied Approach is that of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

### Frenzy
When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A).

When you finish a long rest, you reduce your exhaustion level by 2 rather than 1.<br> Additionally, any effect that removes<br> exhaustion reduces your exhaustion<br> by 1 additional level.

### Maniacal Rage
Also at 3rd level, while raging,<br> when you make a Charisma<br> (Intimidation) check, or a<br> creature makes a Wisdom<br> saving throw to avoid being<br> frightened of you, you add your Strength modifier to the check or save DC, as appropriate.

### Mindless Rage
At 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened<br> while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

### Intimidating Presence
Starting at 10th level, you can use your action<br> to frighten someone with your menacing<br> presence. When you do so, choose one creature<br> that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the<br> creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on<br> a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency<br> bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end<br> of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, it becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours.

### Retaliation
At 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

## Industrial Approach
While some berserkers are content to surrender to their rage, others prefer a more tactful approach. Berserkers of the Industrial Approach augment their rage with the versatility of technology, adding elemental explosions to their already fearsome arsenal.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Techcasting
When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.

#### Tech Powers Known
You learn 3 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.

#### Tech Points
You have a number of tech points equal to half of your berserker level (rounded up), as shown in the Tech Points column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;table.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You may only cast tech powers at<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4th-level once. You regain the<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;ability to do so after a long rest.

#### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Techcasting Ability
Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___

<div align="center">

**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Intelligence modifier

___

**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br>your Intelligence modifier

</div>

___

#### Techcasting Focus
You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook) as a tech focus for your tech powers.

### Industrious Tech
Also at 3rd level, you can cast tech powers while raging as long as the power's casting time is no more than 1 action, the power does not require concentration, and you are not wearing heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield. While raging, you add your rage damage to damage rolls from tech powers you cast. If a tech power damages more than one target, you may only apply your rage damage to one of the targets. 

Casting tech powers during rage counts as attacking for the purposes of maintaining rage, and you can use your Reckless Attack feature to gain advantage when casting a tech power that requires an attack roll.

\pagebreak

### Explosive Resilience
At 6th level, once per round, when you deal damage that includes your rage damage, you can cause a localized explosion around the recipient of that damage. Each creature within 5 feet of the damaged creature other than you takes acid, cold, fire, ion, or lightning damage (your choice) equal to your rage damage bonus, and you gain resistance to the chosen damage type until the end of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

### Painkiller
Starting at 10th level, whenever you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher, or deal damage using your Explosive Resilience feature, you can cause a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet to gain temporary hit points equal to half your berserker level (rounded up) + your Intelligence modifier. Additionally, while they have these temporary hit points, they have advantage on saving throws against effects that would cause them to be frightened.

### Final Countdown
At 14th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, and you have at least one tech point remaining, you can expend all your remaining tech points and instead to drop to one hit point. If you do so, each creature within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 10 acid, cold, fire, ion, or lightning damage (your choice) damage for each tech point spent in this way, or half as much on a successful one.

## Juggernaut Approach
Certain berserkers find that the strongest offense is a good defense. Berserkers of the Juggernaut Approach wear the heaviest of armor not because they fear injury, but to strike fear in their hapless attackers.

### Armored Brute
When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you've learned to fight in the heaviest of armors, using your weight to your advantage. You gain proficiency in heavy armor, you can enter a rage while wearing heavy armor, and you can gain the benefits of your Rage feature while wearing heavy armor. 

### Unstoppable Force
Also at 3rd level, your momentum makes you nigh unstoppable. While raging, you can move through a hostile creature's space regardless of that creature's size. When you do so, you must make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check. If you move at least 10 feet before moving through a hostile creature's space, and that creature is your size or smaller, they have disadvantage on the check. If you succeed, you don't treat the movement as difficult terrain, the creature is pushed 5 feet in a direction of your choice, and you don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature until the end of your turn.

### Raging Bulwark
At 6th level, your imposing form acts as a shield for your allies. When a friendly creature you can see is<br> the target of a ranged attack, or forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, and you can see the source<br> of the effect, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed towards the friendly creature. You must end this move closer to the ally than you started. If you end this movement between your ally and the source of the effect, you provide cover for the attack.

Additionally, you provide three-quarters cover, instead of half-cover, to creatures your size, and you provide full cover to creatures smaller than you.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Overwhelming Cleave
Starting at 10th level, when you successfully push a creature into a surface or another creature while raging, the pushed creature takes kinetic damage equal to your Rage Damage. Additionally, the first time you hit with a melee weapon attack using Strength each turn, you can attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

### Relentless Assault
At 14th level, you're able to charge in unerring bursts. As an action, you can charge up to twice your speed in a straight line without provoking opportunity attacks. Each creature within 5 feet of your path must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier, the target chooses the ability they use use). On a failed save, a creature takes damage equal to your Strength modifier + your Rage Bonus and is pushed back 5 feet in a direction of your choice. Creatures smaller than you make this save with disadvantage. When you end this movement, if a creature is within 5 feet of you, you can make one melee weapon attack (no action required). On a hit, the creature takes additional damage equal to your berserker level.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete<br> a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Way of Confluence
The Force binds us, creating an intangible bridge connecting all living things. Those consulars who follow the Way of Confluence master this power, manipulating those connections to both sustain and torment.
 
### Manipulate Life Force
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a force power, or restore hit points to a creature with 0 hit points with a force power, you gain temporary hit points equal to half your consular level (rounded down) + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).

### Empowered Connection
At 6th level, while you have temporary hit points, you can add half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, rounded up, minimum of one) to any damage or healing you do with force powers that doesn't already include that modifier. 

### Life Eternal
Beginning at 10th level, you can use your powerful connection to the Force to keep fighting when others would fall. When you are reduced to 0 hit<br> points but not killed outright, you can<br> spend 5 force points to drop<br> to 1 hit point instead. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Interconnectedness
At 14th level, when you cast a 5th level or lower force power that deals damage or restores hit points and targets only one creature, the power can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Dynamic Attachment
Starting at 18th level, while you have temporary hit points, you have resistance against the damage of force powers, and your force powers ignore resistances.

## Way of Endurance
The Force manifests in myriad ways; while some use the Force to manipulate the world around them, others use it to enhance themselves. Those consulars who follow the Way of Endurance channel the Force to allow them to overcome and reflect the most grievous of injuries.
 
### Upheld by the Force
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, the Force flowing through your body strengthens you, granting the following benefits:
- Your hit point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.
- Your base AC becomes 13 + your Constitution modifier. 
- When you make a melee weapon attack as a part of a force power you cast, you can use Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls.

Additionally, as an action, you can gain resistance to kinetic and energy damage for 1 minute. This effect lasts until you end it as a bonus action, you are incapacitated, or you don armor other than a shield. You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

### Retaliation Strike
At 6th level, you learn to turn<br> an opponent's aggression back<br> on them. When you deal damage<br> with a force power or a melee weapon<br> attack, if you took damage since the start<br> of your last turn, you deal an extra 1d6<br> damage. The damage is the same type as the<br> power or weapon's damage.

This die increases when you reach certain<br> levels in this class: to 1d8 at 10th level, to 1d10<br> at 14th level, and to 1d12 at 18th level.

### Boundless Vitality

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Unrelenting Resilience
At 14th level, when you use your Boundless Vitality feature while concentrating on a force power, you can add the result of the roll to the Constitution saving throw made to maintain concentration.

Additionally, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright while Upheld by the Force is active, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

### The Force Unleashed
Starting at 18th level, as an action, you can choose a point within 60 feet. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of that point must make a Constitution saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 force damage and suffers 1 level of exhaustion. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and does not suffer exhaustion.

For each creature that fails this saving throw, a friendly creature within 30 feet of them can regain hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt. A friendly creature can only gain this benefit once per turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Way of Manipulation
The power of the Force is both vast and diverse, with uses varying drastically based on their wielder. Those consulars who follow the Way of Manipulation learn to control their weapons with the Force, maneuvering them across the battlefield.

### Saber Storm
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn to deftly control your weapons utilizing the Force. As an action, you can initiate your Saber Storm. When you do so, select a light- or vibro-weapon within 5 feet that is not worn or carried by a conscious creature other than you, and use the Force to cause it to levitate, acting as an extension of your will for 1 minute. When you activate this feature, you can cause the weapon to move up to 10 feet and make a melee force attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 + your forcecasting ability modifier damage. The type is of the normal damage dealt by the weapon. The weapon then returns to your side.

Your weapon moves with you, and while Saber Storm is active and you have a weapon animated, on each of your turns you can use an action to move a weapon up to 10 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. The weapon then returns to your side. Your Saber Storm ends early if you are incapacitated. At any time, you can end this feature and return the animated weapon to your hand.

Additionally, while your Saber Storm is active, and at least one animated weapon is within 5 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:
- You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1) if it doesn't already include that modifier.
- You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a power. The bonus equals your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1).

This feature can animate more than one weapon when you reach higher levels: two weapons<br> at 5th level, three weapons at 11th level,<br> and four weapons at 17th level. When<br> you use your action to attack with your<br> weapons, you can direct them at the<br> same target or at different ones. Make a<br> separate attack roll for each weapon.

At 5th level, the distance your weapon can travel increases to 20 feet. This distance increases to 30 feet at 11th level, and 40 feet at 17th level.

You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

### Deceptive Strike
At 6th level, when you cast a force power with a range of touch while Saber Storm is active, your animated weapon can move up to its range and deliver the power as if it had cast it. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Guarding Weapon
Beginning at 10th level, you can direct your animated weapons to absorb damage while your Saber Storm is activate. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to expend one force slot to have your animated weapon intercept it, and reduce that damage to you by an amount equal to five times the force slot's level.

### Isolate
At 14th level, when you deal damage to a creature while Saber Storm is active, and that creature fails a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a force power, you can steal and redirect the power. Until the end of your next turn, either you or the creature who failed the Constitution saving throw gain the effects of the power (your choice).

### Sapping Storm 
Starting at 18th level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points while Saber Storm is active, you gain temporary force points equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). These temporary force points can not exceed your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice), and when you would spend a force point while you have temporary force points, the temporary force points are spent first. When Saber Storm ends, you lose any remaining temporary force points.

## Way of Negation
Some force users seek mastery over the fundamentals of energy manipulation, known as tutaminis. Those consulars who follow the Way of Negation harness this power to limit the havoc that other force-wielders might wreak.

### Force Deflection
At 3rd level, when you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a +4 bonus to that saving throw.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

### Power Surge
Starting at 6th level, you learn to simultaneously limit a creature's force powers and store that power within yourself to later strengthen your damaging force powers.

You can store a maximum number of power surges equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). Whenever you successfully end a force power with a power such as *force suppression* or *sever force*, or use your Force Shield or Force Deflection features to successfully avoid an attack or succeed on a saving throw, you gain one power surge, as you redirect the flow of the Force into yourself. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

&emsp;Once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature or object with a force power, you can spend one power surge to deal extra damage to that target. The extra damage is of the same type as the power's damage, and it equals half your consular level (rounded down).

Whenever you finish a long rest, your number of power surges resets to one. If you end a short rest with no power surges, you gain one power surge.

### Enduring Focus
At 10th level, you can casually deflect attacks while channeling your power. While you are concentrating on a Force power, you have a +2 bonus to your AC and all saving throws.

Additionally, you can extend your Force Deflection to a creature within 5 feet of you when they fail a saving throw.

### Conflux
At 14th level, when you use your Force Deflection feature, you can cause a ripple in the Force to expand from you. Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you each take force damage equal to half your consular level.

### Tutaminis Mastery
At 18th level, when you use a Force-Empowered Casting option, you can spend a power surge to use it without spending additional force points.

## Way of Technology
While many Forcewielders eschew the use of technology, other choose to embrace it. Those consulars who follow the Way of Technology pair their mastery of the Force with the versatility of technology, applying the knowledge in tandem to perform unseen feats.
 
### Fundamentals of Mechu-deru
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you've dabbled in adapting your use of the Force, melding it with technology. You gain proficiency in the Technology skill, as well as simple blasters. When you cast a force power that calls for a melee weapon attack, and you are wielding a blaster with which you are proficient, you can instead make a ranged weapon attack, as long as the target is within your weapon's normal range.

Additionally, you've learned to manipulate the Force to be able to manipulate technology when it couldn't previously. When you cast a force power that could not affect droids or constructs, you can choose to have it affect droids or constructs. If it would affect multiple targets, you must expend additional uses of this feature for each additional target. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Techcasting Secrets
At 6th level, you've learned to mimic technological effects. Choose two tech powers of 1st level. The chosen powers count as universal force powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the consular table.

At 10th level, you learn two additional tech powers of 1st or 2nd level. At 14th level, you learn two tech powers of 1st-3rd level, and at 18th level, you learn two tech powers of 1st-4th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tech powers you know and replace it with another tech power of the same level.

### Ionized Weave
Beginning at 10th level, when you cast a damage-dealing force power that requires a force attack or saving throw, you can spend force points to cause that power to instead deal ion damage. The number of force points equals half the power's level (round down, minimum of one). If the power would call for a saving throw other than Dexterity, it instead calls for a Dexterity saving throw. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Force Circuitry
At 14th level, when you use your action to cast a force power, and you use your Fundamentals of Mechu-deru feature as a part of that casting, you can use your bonus action to cast one of the tech powers you know, as long as that power has a casting time of 1 action or bonus action.

### Mechu-deru Mastery
Starting at 18th level, you can cast one 5th-level tech power of your choice at its base level. The power counts as a universal force power for you, and you do not require force points to cast this power. Once you've done so, you can't do so again until you complete a long rest.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/WrotCbm.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:28px;right:25px;width:535px;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(-1)' />

## Way of Telekinetics
The consular knows how to manipulate the essence of the surrounding elements with the power of the Force. Those consulars who follow the Way of Telekinetics create torrential gusts of telekinetic energy, forming a potent combination that can pummel even the toughest adversaries into submission.

### Staggering Stratagem
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your potency with the telekinetic power of the Force heightens. You can manipulate creatures of Large size or smaller with your force powers and Way of Telekinetics features. Additionally, once per turn, when you deal force or kinetic damage to a Large or smaller creature with a force power or class feature, you can choose to either push it up to 10 feet away from you or pull it up to 10 feet closer to you.

### Mighty Blast
At 6th level, your force powers batter and blast your enemies with the strength of a hurricane. When you cast a force power of 1st level or higher that deals force or kinetic damage, one creature of your choice damaged by that power must make a Strength saving throw against your universal force save DC or be knocked prone. 

This feature can affect additional creatures when you reach higher levels: two creatures at 11th<br> level and three creatures at 17th level.

### Size Matters Not
Beginning at 10th level, you can<br> manipulate creatures of Huge size or<br> smaller with your force powers and<br> Way of Telekinetics features.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

&emsp;Additionally, when you use your action to cast a force power, you can use a bonus action to fly up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Repulsing Wave
At 14th level, when you are dealt damage by a creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to deal force damage to the creature equal to your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1). If the attacker is Huge or smaller, it must also make a Strength saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, the attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet away from you.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

### My Ally is the Force
Starting at 18th level, you can manipulate creatures of Gargantuan size or smaller with your force powers and Way of Telekinetics features.

Additionally, whenever a force power you cast pushes or pulls a creature, you can increase the distance of that push or pull by an additional 20 feet.

## Way of the Seer
The Force guides us in innumerable ways, often manifesting as visions. Those consulars who follow the Way of Seer attempt to harness these visions in an attempt to work towards the best possible future, as they see it.

### Force Visions
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

### Powerful Mind
At 6th level, you can use your force abilities to read a creature's thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature's mind to command it.

As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can't use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest. If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about.) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute. During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and use the *coerce mind* force power on the creature without expending force points. The target automatically fails its saving throw against the power. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your<br> choice, a minimum of once). You regain<br> any expended uses when you finish a<br> long rest.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Visions of the Past
Beginning at 10th level, you can call up visions of the past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate surroundings. You spend at least 1 minute in meditation, then receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses of recent events. You can meditate in this way for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom score and must maintain concentration during that time, as if you were casting a force power. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Object Reading.*** Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object's previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.

***Area Reading.*** As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.

### Shielded Thoughts
At 14th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;same amount of damage that you do. 

### Clarity of Vision
Starting at 18th level, the visions in your dreams<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;intensify and paint a more accurate picture in<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;your mind of what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Force Visions feature, rather than two.

## Astrotech Engineering
Those engineers who choose the Astrotech Engineering discipline focus on crafting and upgrading their droid companions.

### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this discipline at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in astrotech's implements. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with astrotech's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.

### Droid Companion
Also at 3rd level, you learn to employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to create and customize your own personalized droid companion.

Choose your droid, which is detailed at the end of this discipline. Over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of materials to finally finish your droid.

If your droid is irreparably destroyed, or you want to interface with a different droid, you can spend an additional 250 credits and 1 hour to change the target of this feature. You may only have one droid companion at a time.

Your droid gains a variety of benefits while it is interfaced with you:
- The droid obeys your commands as best it can. It acts on your turn, and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your droid acts on its own.
- Your droid's level equals your engineer level, and for each engineer level you gain after 3rd, your droid companion gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly.
- Your droid has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level.
- Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature in this class, your droid's abilities also improve. Your droid can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your droid can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.
- Your droid can not wear armor, but you can have the armor professionally integrated into its chassis. Over the course of a long rest, you can expend materials equal to half the cost of the armor in order to integrate it into your droid. Your droid must be proficient in armor in order to have it integrated.
- Your droid is a valid target of the *tracker droid interface* tech power.

The cold damage and kinetic damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

#### Coercing Shot

Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.

The extra damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

You can do so no more than once per turn.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Strength Before Death
Starting at 18th level, your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death. If you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to delay falling unconscious, and you can immediately take an extra turn.

## Kage Order
Monks of the Kage Order, known as Kage warriors, have mastered fighting in darkness, using that which others fear as a weapon against them. Kage warriors learn tricks to create darkness where none exists, fighting using their intuition rather than relying on sight.

### Darkness Charges
Beginning when you choose this order at 3rd level, you learn to create a number of small charges that create enhanced darkness. Over the course of a short or long rest, you can create a number of charges equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). Your charges can only be used by you, and they lose their potency at the end of your next short or long rest.

Once per turn, when you would make a weapon attack or unarmed strike, you can instead throw one of your charges. Your charges have a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. You can throw a device at a point you can see within range. The charges create a pocket of darkness in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on that point. The darkness spreads around corners. It lasts for 1 minute or until an enhanced source of brigiht light dispells it.

### Disruptive Shock
At 6th level, once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack when you have advantage, or it fails a saving throw against an effect that you control, you can choose to roll a Martial Arts die and deal additional psychic damage equal to the<br> amount rolled. 

You can use this feature a<br> number of times equal to your<br> Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice,<br> a minimum of once). You regain any<br> expended uses when you finish a short or<br> long rest.

### One With Darkness
Starting at 11th level, you have learned to<br> become one with the shadows. When you are in<br> an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible. You<br> remain invisible until you<br> make an attack, cast a power,<br> or are in an area of bright<br> light.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Opportunist
At 17th level, you can exploit a creature's momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.

## Kyuzo Order
Monks of the Kyuzo Order turn weapon throwing into a true art form. Inspired by the skill of native kyuzo wielding their war helmets as both shield and weapon, these monks utilize any thrown object they can find to defend themselves and others while they attack enemies from angles both surprising and devastating.

### Intercept
When you choose this order at 3rd level,<br> you gain proficiency in vibroweapons with<br> the thrown property and they become monk<br> weapons for you. Additionally, when you throw an improvised weapon, you are considered proficient in it, and it use your Martial Arts die instead of its 1d4. 

Additionally, you've learned to use thrown weapons to intercept projectiles traveling towards your allies. When you are wielding a weapon with which you are<br> proficient, and a creature within your weapon's<br> normal thrown range is hit by a ranged<br> attack, you can use your reaction to throw<br> your weapon to intercept the projectile. When<br> you do so, the damage the creature takes from<br> the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity<br> modifier + your monk level. If the weapon has<br> the returning property, it then returns to your<br> hand.

### Scattering Stance
At 6th level, when you take the Dodge action, until the start of your next turn you gain a number of special reactions equal to your proficiency bonus that you can only use for your Intercept feature. You can only take one reaction per turn.

### Curved Throw
Starting at 11th level, you can curve your throws<br> behind cover. When you make an attack roll<br> with a weapon with the thrown property, you<br> can spend 1 focus point to cause the target<br> to gain no benefit from shields or cover,<br> unless that cover is full cover.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Relentless Assault
At 17th level, when you make multiple weapon attacks with thrown weapons against the same target on your turn, each attack after the first gains a +1 bonus to its attack roll, cumulatively, to a maximum bonus of +6.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/5aztMYq.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:21px;right:30px;width:600px;transform:scaleX(-1);z-index:1000' />

## Trickster Order
Monks of the Trickster Order embody the archetypal role of the "trickster"— one who seemingly bumbles their way into good fortune. They employ a unique fighting style composed of slips, trips, and falls to confuse and frustrate their enemies to no end. Whether your movements are actual foibles on your part or calculated strokes, they will surely leave others guessing long after your time is past.

### Bumbling Technique
When you choose this order at 3rd level, your martial arts technique mixes combat training with the precision of a dancer and the antics of a jester. When you make a Charisma (Performance) check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to half your Wisdom modifier (rounded down, minimum of +1) if it doesn't already include that modifier.

Additionally, you learn how to twist and turn quickly. Whenever you use your bonus action to make an unarmed strike, creatures you hit can't make opportunity attacks against you, and your<br> speed increases by 10 feet until the end<br> of your turn.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Clumsy Sway
At 6th level, you can move in sudden, swaying ways. You gain the following benefits.

***Leap to Your Feet.*** When you're prone, you can stand up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.

***Redirect Attack.*** When a creature misses you with a melee attack roll, you can spend 1 focus point as a reaction to cause that attack to hit one creature of your choice, other than the attacker, that you can see within 5 feet of you.

### Luck of the Fool
Starting at 11th level, you always seem to get a lucky bounce at the right moment. When you make an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw and have disadvantage, you can spend 2 focus points to instead have advantage for that roll.

### Comic Frenzy
At 17th level, you gain the ability to make an overwhelming number of attacks against a group of enemies. When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can make up to three additional attacks with it (up to a total of five Flurry of Blows attacks), provided that each Flurry of Blows attack targets a different creature this turn.

## Whills Order  
Monks of the Whills Order hold the secrets of the Force sacred, and dedicate their lives to defending ancient  knowledge of the Force and its artifacts. They master the use of ranged weapons, often crafting their own weapons in respectful admiration of the Jedi tradition of crafting lightweapons.

### Flurry of Light
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in blaster pistols, blaster rifle, ion blaster, ion rifle, and the lightbow, which are your Whills weapons and are monk weapons for you. When you are wielding a Whills weapon, you gain the following benefits:
- Your Whills weapons count as melee weapons for you, and when you make a melee weapon attack with them, you deal kinetic damage equal to your Martial Arts Damage Die.
- When you would make an unarmed strike<br> using your Martial Arts bonus action<br> or as a part of<br> your<br> Flurry of Blows, you can instead attack with a Whills weapon you are wielding. You roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your Whills weapon when attacking in this way. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the monk table.
- When you would make a ranged weapon attack with a Whills weapon, you can instead reload the weapon.

### The Force is With You
At 6th level, as you channel the Force through you, you gain the following benefits:
- You can use your Stunning Strike feature when you hit with a ranged weapon attack while you are wielding a Whills weapon. 
- You can spend 1 focus point to ignore one-quarter and half cover with your Whills weapons. At 11th level, you can spend 2 focus points to ignore three quarters cover. At 17th level, you can spend 3 focus points to ignore total cover, as long as your target is not hidden from you. 
- When you hit a creature with a Whills weapon, that creature has disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you until the start of your next turn.

### One With the Force
At 11th level, you learn how to enter a trance, preparing to unleash yourself upon your enemy. While in this trance, you can still talk and move. If you stay in the trance for at least one minute, when you roll initiative, you can make a ranged weapon attack on a number of creatures up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of one) within 30 feet of you when you were in this trance.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

\columnbreak

### Guided Strikes
At 17th level, your first ranged weapon attack and your first melee weapon attack each turn deal additional damage equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of +1).

## Disabling Practice
Those operatives who choose the Disabling Practice utilize a variety of pushes, pulls, weight shifts, and joint locks to immobilize their opponent. They use these techniques to manipulate their opponent, moving them across the battlefield before incapacitating them.

### Clinch Strike
When you choose this practice at 3rd level, you learn how to discourage, debilitate, and harm your enemies. You gain the following benefits while you aren't wearing heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield:
- Your damage die for your unarmed strikes and natural weapons increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).
- You can deal Sneak Attack damage when making an unarmed strike. Additionally, you don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if the target of your Sneak Attack is a creature grappled by you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.
- You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make an unarmed strike against a creature you are grappling.

### Skilled Grappler
Also at 3rd level, you learn a number of grappling techniques to subdue your opponents. When you hit a creature grappled by you with an unarmed strike and deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a grappling technique.

Some of your grappling techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the grappling technique's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

___

<div align="center">

**Grapple Technique save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br> your Strength modifier

</div>

___

#### Constrict
You attempt to choke the target into<br> unconsciousness. The target must make a<br> Constitution saving throw or be restrained<br> until the end of your following turn.  

If you maintain this technique for 1<br> minute, the target falls unconscious for 1<br> hour. Droids and constructs can not be<br> knocked unconscious in this way.

#### Disarm
You attempt to disarm a weapon or other object the target is holding. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it releases the object. If you have a free hand, you can catch the object. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.

\columnbreak

<div style ='margin-top:27px'></div>

#### Hip Toss
You attempt to throw your target to the ground. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed back 5 feet, knocked prone, and stunned until the start of your next turn. This ends the grapple.

### Human Shield
Beginning at 9th level you learn to manipulate the body of a grappled target to make attacks against you more difficult to land. Moving a grappled creature the same size as you or smaller no longer halves your speed, and when a creature grappled by you would grant you half cover, you instead have three-quarters cover. Additionally, when you are hit by an attack while grappling a creature, you can use your reaction to force that attack to instead hit the grappled creature.

### Kiss the Wall
Starting at 13th level, you can use your surroundings to further punish the target of your grapple. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a Sneak Attack damage die for an unarmed strike you make against a creature grappled by you, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

### Neck Snap
At 17th level, you learn how to immediately remove your grappled opponent from the fight. As an action, you can force a creature grappled by you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, if the creature has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. If the target has more than 100 hit points, it immediately takes &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;10d10 kinetic damage. This damage can't be &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;reduced in any way.

Once&emsp;&emsp; you've used this feature, you must<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;complete a short or long rest before you can&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; use it&emsp;&emsp; again.

## Lethality Practice
Those operatives who choose the Lethality Practice use disguises to get close to their enemies, then leverage the toxic power of poisons to debilitate them and capitalize on their weaknesses. 

### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this practice at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner's kit.

### Assassinate
Also at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. Additionally, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

### Lethal Strikes
Lastly at 3rd level, you learn how to read your foes and strikes their weak points. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a lethal strike. 

Some of your lethal strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the lethal strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

___

<div align="center">

**Lethal Strike save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Dexterity modifier

</div>

___

#### Priming Attack
You attempt to prime the target. The target must make a Dexterity, Constitution, or Wisdom saving throw (your choice). On a failed save, the next time you deal Sneak Attack damage against the target before the end of your next turn, you roll four additional Sneak Attack dice.

#### Target Assessment
You attempt to infer crucial details about your foe. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the GM tells you two of the following characteristics of your choice:
- Highest ability score
- Lowest ability score
- Strongest saving throw
- Weakest saving throw

#### Vulnerable Strike
You attempt to stagger the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the next time you would make an attack roll against the target before the end of your next turn, you can instead force the target to make a saving throw with the ability score of your choice. On a failed save, the creature takes normal weapon damage and you can apply your Sneak Attack dice to the roll.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Poisoner
Beginning at 9th level, you are a master of poisons. You can apply a poison as a bonus action, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal the application of poisons. 

Additionally, you can improve the capability of one dose of poison. To use this benefit, you must have a poisoner's kit, and the poison must be within reach. If the poison is applied before the end of your next short or long rest, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw made to resist your poison. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

### Impostor
Starting at 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least 1 minute studying these three components of the person's behavior: listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms. If you can only study some of these aspects (such as only having writing samples, or only audio recordings), you can mimic that aspect of the person, but not other aspects you have not studied.

Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.

### Death Strike
At 17th level, you become a<br> master of instant<br> death. When you<br> deal weapon<br> damage to a<br> creature that is<br> surprised, it must<br> make a Constitution<br> saving throw against<br> your lethal strike<br> save DC. On a <br>failed save, double<br> the damage of<br> your attack against<br> the creature.

### Artful Dancer
When you choose this practice at 3rd level, your training with music and dancing grants you certain benefits. You gain proficiency in the Performance skill and one musical instrument of your choice.

Additionally, while you are you are not wearing armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield, you can add half your Charisma modifier (rounded up) to your AC as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.

Also at 3rd level, you learn to conduct impressive displays of grace and speed in combat. While you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield, and you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a weapon with either the light or finesse properties, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, and if you deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a dazzling step.

Some of your dazzling steps require your target to make a saving throw to resist the dazzling step's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

___

<div align="center">

**Dazzling Step save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Charisma modifier

</div>

___

#### Defensive Step
You defend yourself from further attack. Roll two Sneak Attack dice. You gain temporary hit points that last until the start of your next turn equal to the amount rolled.

#### Mobile Step
You twist and twirl around the target. The target must make a Strength saving throw. A Huge or larger creature automatically succeeds. On a failed save, it is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately move into the space it just vacated without provoking opportunity attacks.

#### Offensive Step
Choose another creature that you can see<br> within your reach. The creature must make a<br> Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, roll<br> two Sneak Attack dice. The creature takes<br> damage equal to the amount rolled. This<br> damage is of the same as your weapon's<br> damage.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Flexible Body
Beginning at 9th level, you are able to use your acrobatic talent to gain the upper hand in combat. You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to shove a creature. When you do so, you can make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check instead of a Strength (Athletics) check. 

Additionally, you now ignore difficult terrain, you can move through space occupied by hostile creatures, and you can squeeze through smaller spaces without expending extra movement.

### Dance of Death
Starting at 13th level, you can use your action to make a weapon attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. You can choose to deal Sneak Attack damage to each creature you hit, but you can only roll half your number of Sneak Attack dice (rounded up) per creature.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Master of Dance
At 17th level, your confidence when putting on a show has extended into combat. You add your Charisma modifier to initiative checks. Additionally, any creature who fails a saving throw against your Dazzling Step save DC has disadvantage on the first attack roll they make against you<br> each turn until the<br> end of your next<br> turn.

### Rakish Audacity
When you choose this practice at 3rd level, your unmistakable confidence propels you into battle. You can add your Charisma modifier to your initiative rolls.

Additionally, you don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if no creature other than your target is within 5 feet of you, as long as the target of the attack is within 5 feet of you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.

Finally, during your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.

### Nimble Step
Also at 3rd level, you learn to fluidly strike and maneuver through combat. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to maneuver across the battlefield.

Some of your fancy footworks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the debilitating strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

___

<div align="center">

**Nimble Step save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br> your Dexterity modifier.

</div>

___

#### Blade Defense
You attempt to determine your target's next strike. Roll two Sneak Attack dice, and the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your AC increases by the higher amount rolled on the dice against the first attack it makes against you before the start of your next turn. On a successful save, your AC instead increases by the lower amount.

#### Disarming Strike
You attempt to disarm a creature with your attack. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. If you have a free hand, you can catch the item. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.

#### Fancy Footwork
Roll two Sneak Attack dice. Your speed increases by 5 x the greater result of the two dice, and you ignore difficult terrain until the end of your current turn.

### Panache
Beginning at 9th level, your charm becomes extraordinarily beguiling. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

&emsp;If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can't make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a power, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart.

If you succeed on the check and the creature isn't hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.

### Elegant Maneuver
Starting at 13th level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during the same turn.

### Master Duelist

### Tracker Droid Companion
Also at 3rd level, you learn to employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to create and customize your own personalized tracker droid companion.

Your tracker droid is detailed at the end of this practice. Over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of materials to finally finish your tracker droid.

If your tracker droid is irreparable destroyed, or you want to interface with a different tracker droid, you can spend an additional 250 credits and 1 hour to change the target of this feature. You may only have one tracker droid companion at a time.

Your tracker droid gains a variety of benefits while it is interfaced with you:
- The tracker droid obeys your commands as best it can. It acts on your turn, and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your tracker droid acts on its own.
- Your tracker droid's level equals your operative level, and for each operative level you gain after 3rd, your tracker droid companion gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly.
- Your tracker droid has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level.
- Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature in this class, your tracker droid's abilities also improve. Your tracker droid can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your tracker droid can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.
- Your tracker droid can not wear armor or have armor integrated in its chassis.
- Your tracker droid is a valid target of the *tracker droid interface* tech power.

### Ion Pulse
Starting at 13th level, as a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one or more of your tracker droid's Hit Dice to have it emit an pulse of ion energy. Each creature within 5 feet of your tracker droid must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. A creature takes 1d4 ion damage for each Hit Die expended in this way on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. Any electronics not being worn or carried within the blast radius are disabled until rebooted.

### Sabotage
At 17th level, you gain the ability to sabotage a tech power in the process of being cast. When a hostile creature casts a tech power, and you are the target of the tech power or within its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make an Intelligence saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, the power is cast as normal.

On a failed save, you negate the power's effects, and the caster takes 1d6 lightning damage per level of the power it was casting. Additionally, on a failed save, the caster's tech focus used to cast the tech power is overloaded and can't be used to cast tech powers for 1 minute. 

At the end of each of the caster's turns, it can repeat the Intelligence saving throw. On a success, it can use the tech focus to cast tech powers again.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Sawbones Practice
Those operatives who choose the Sawbones Practice have studied the humanoid body on a more intimate level than other operatives. While others may know where best to stab in order to kill, you also know how to repair the wounds you inflict, as well as how to make them even deeper. You delve into the secrets of the body, learning as much medical knowledge as you can get your hands on, regardless of how dirty the work becomes.

### General Practice
When you choose this practice at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Medicine, and you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier for checks made with it.

Additionally, you can expend one use of a medkit to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

### Debilitating Strike
Also at 3rd level, you learn to apply your anatomical knowledge in direct combat, in order to hinder your targets. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to hinder the creature, provided they have the appropiate physiology.

Some of your debilitating strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the debilitating strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

___

<div align="center">

**Debilitating Strike save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

</div>

___

#### Bleeding Wound
You attempt to create a lingering wound in the target for one minute. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, at the start of each of the target's turns, it loses 1d6 hit points and repeats this saving throw, ending the effect on a success. This damage can't be reduced in any way.

#### Crippling Pain
You attempt to cause cause distracting pain in the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of your next turn. 

#### Hampering Shot

### Dosage Control
Starting at 13th level, your knowledge of medicine allows you to partition and ration healing supplies very effectively, without impacting its potency. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a rest, you can carefully measure and mark out dosages of a medpac within reach. The medpac can now be used twice before it is consumed.

At your DM's discretion, you may be able to use this feature on other pacs, stims, or adrenals, most likely involving an ability check to succeed.

### Self-Sustain
At 17th level, you have advantage on death saving throws.

Additionally, when you are stabilized, you regain 1 hit point. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Illusionist Technique
Among the galaxy you may find the various infiltrators and agents who make ample use of holographic technology to get themselves in and out of danger. Followers of the Illusionist Technique make use of this holographic technology to give themselves an illusory edge in combat.

### Holographic Decoy
When you choose this technique at 3rd level, as an action, you can create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 10 minutes, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a power). The decoy appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. The decoy is purely visual. If anything passes through it, it is revealed to be an illusion. For the duration, you can cast tech powers as though you were in the decoy's space. Both your decoy and the target of your tech power must be within your line of sight.

You can use your bonus action to cause the decoy to move up to 30 feet. As your decoy changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the decoy. If your decoy is ever more than 120 feet away from you, it immediately disappears.

Additionally, when both you and your decoy are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the decoy, but is not aware it is an illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature.

A creature that uses its action to examine your decoy can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what<br> it is, the creature can see through the image.

Once you've used this feature, you must<br> complete a short or long rest before you<br> &emsp;can use it again.

When you choose this technique at 3rd level, you have learned to use your wits to help you survive. While you are wearing light or medium armor, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier when determining your AC. 

### Mark of the Meticulous
Also at 3rd level, you can use Intelligence instead of Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls made with weapons with the finesse property or blaster weapons against the target of your Ranger's Quarry.

Additionally, once per round, when you hit the target of your Ranger's Quarry with a tech attack, or it fails a saving throw against a tech power you cast that deals damage, you can deal additional damage equal to your Ranger's Quarry damage die of the same type as the tech power's damage.

### Adaptive Techie
Beginning at 7th level, when you complete a long rest, you can choose up to a number of tech powers you know equal to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded down) and replace them with another tech power, as long as that power is not of a higher level than your Max Power Level.

### Emergency Planning
Starting at 11th level, you've learned to formulate and execute a plan. As an action, you can choose up to six creatures (including yourself) that you can see within 60 feet of you. For each creature, choose one of the following: ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Each creature gains an Emergency Planning die, which is a d8.

Once within the next 10 minutes, each creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, as determined when you use this feature. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Emergency Planning die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Emergency Planning die is rolled, it is lost.

A creature can have only one Emergency Planning die at a time.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

Your Emergency Planning die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

### Exploit Weakness
At 15th level, your training has taught you to find and exploit weaknesses in your prey. As a bonus action, you can impose disadvantage on the next saving throw the target of your Ranger's Quarry makes against an effect you control before the end of your next turn. Once you've done so, you must complete a short or long rest before you can do so again.

## Predator Technique
Some scouts work in solitude, while others prefer the strength of a group. Followers of the Predator Technique find power lies with the pack; they distract their prey, while their allies go for the kill.

### Bonus Proficiencies
You gain proficiency in heavy armor.

### Hunting Party
When you choose this technique at 3rd level, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Mark of the Predator
Also at 3rd level, if the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature can see you, a number of friendly creatures you choose up to your Intelligence modifier have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide from it.

### Predator's Resolve
Beginning at 7th level, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
- You have advantage on Constitution saving throws.
- At the start of each of your turns, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one).
- When you use your Hunting Party feature and the target of the attack is your Ranger's Quarry, your ally gains a bonus to damage on the attack equal to your Ranger's Quarry Damage Die.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Prey on the Weak
Starting at 11th level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, and the creature is below its hit point maximum, the next attack roll made against that creature before the end of your next turn by someone other than you has advantage.

### On the Hunt
At 15th level, when you use your Predator's Resolve feature, a number of friendly creatures you choose up to your Intelligence modifier that you can see within 30 feet of you also gain the benefits of the feature.

## Teleportation Technique
&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether through experimentation or discovery of<br> &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an ancient technology, followers of the<br> &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teleportation Technique have learned to create<br> &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brief teleportation portals, allowing them to<br> &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maneuver and attack both quickly and<br> &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unpredictably throughout the battlefield.

### Personal Teleporter
When you choose this technique at 3rd level, you can use portable teleporters as a bonus action, instead of an action. 

Additionally, while you are wielding a tech focus, you can use your bonus action to create a pair of linked portals: one portal appears in a space within 5 feet of you, and the other portal appears in an unoccupied space you can see up to 30 feet away. These portals last until the start of your next turn, and they are large enough to accommodate Medium and smaller creatures and objects. Portals take the appearance of an elongated, shimmering mirror, and looking through a portal, a creature can see through the linked portal as if looking through a window. A creature or object who passes through a portal immediately appears in a space within 5 feet of the linked portal. You can use your reaction to end your portals early. If a creature is partially within your portals, it is shunted back to the space it previously occupied and it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your a tech save DC. On a failed save, it takes energy damage equal to your scout level + your Intelligence modifier.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest. At the beginning of each of your turns while you have a pair of portals active, you can expend a use of this feature to extend the duration of the portals until the start of your next turn (no action required).

The distance at which you can create portals increases at higher levels. It increases to 60 feet at 5th level, 90 feet at 9th level, 150 feet at 13th level, 300 feet at 17th level, and 1,000 feet at 20th level.

### Mark of the Teleporter
Also at 3rd level, on your turn, when you deal damage to the target of your Ranger's Quarry, and either you, your weapon, or the source of your damage have passed through your portals on this turn, when you roll below half the maximum on a damage die, you can treat the roll as if you'd rolled half the maximum on the damage die. You can only affect a number of dice up to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded up, minimum of one) in this way.

### Residual Warp
Beginning at 7th level, when you use your Personal Teleporter feature, you can place your portal in a place you've visited in the last 10 minutes, provided you can remember it, as opposed to a place you can see. That place must still be within range of your teleporter.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Quantum Entanglement
Starting at 11th level, when you use your Personal Teleporter feature, you can place the portal that you would normally place within 5 feet of you in a place you can see within your Personal Teleporter's range. If that space is occupied by a Huge or smaller creature or a Medium or smaller unsecured object, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. An object automatically fails this saving throw, and a creature can choose to fail. On a failed save, a Medium or smaller creature or object falls through the portal, immediately appearing in a space within 5 feet of the linked portal and falling prone. A Large or Huge creature instead falls prone without moving.

### Reprisal
At 15th level, when you would be affected by a weapon or tech power that requires a Dexterity saving throw or attack roll and would affect only you, you can use your reaction to instantaneously create a pair of portals to redirect that power to another target within 30 feet. If the weapon or power required a melee or ranged attack roll, make a melee or ranged tech attack roll against the new target, as appropriate. If it required a Dexterity saving throw, the new target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Path of Communion
Those who master the Force can transcend death, persisting beyond their natural experation. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Communion bond with a Force ghost, developing a symbiotic relationship which alters the way they perceive their surroundings.

### Mystical Connection
Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you learn the *feedback* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and the target fails its saving throw. Finally, when you deal psychic damage with the *feedback* force power, you deal additional psychic damage equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) if it doesn't already include that modifier.

### Symbiot Spirit
Also at 3rd level, you attract the attention of the spirit of a Force ghost. Over the course of one hour, you can attune to the spirit, forging a lasting connection. While attuned to a spirit, you gain the following benefits:
- Your spirit is always audible and visible to you. Your spirit can choose to make itself audible and visible or inaudible and invisible to other creatures (no action required), but it is always visible to beings with truesight.
- Your spirit can not interact with the corporeal world, but it is also not impeded by unenhanced walls or barriers.
- Your spirit acts independently of you, and it only obeys your commands if it chooses to. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. Your spirit can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
- While your spirit is within 100 feet of you, you can telepathically communicate with it. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your spirit's vision and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.
- When you cast a force power with a range of touch, your spirit can deliver the power as if it had cast it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the power when you cast it. If the power requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

You can only attune to one spirit at a time. If you attempt to attune to another spirit, you immediately break the bond with your current spirit.

> #### Generating Your Spirit
> Your spirit might be the ghost of a benevolent Jedi, discovered in the ruins of a Jedi temple, or a powerful Sith spirit lingering in an ancient artifact. It might be the spirit of a Nightsister sorceress, or a paragon of a long-forgotten monastic order. Work with your GM to determine the nature of your spirit.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

&emsp;Additionally, your spirit can briefly interact with the physical world. When you would make a melee attack, your spirit can deliver the attack as if it had made it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the attack. It uses your modifiers for the attack and damage rolls. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

### Invasive Presence
At 7th level, your spirit can invade another creature's being. As an action, your spirit can touch a creature within 5 feet of it, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw. 

On a failed save, your spirit moves into that creatures space, inhabiting its body, for 1 minute. The affected creature has disadvantage on the first attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes each turn. At the end of each its turns, the creature repeats this save. On a success, it repels the spirit from its body, and it becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

### Ethereal Vision
By 13th level, you and your guiding spirit both gain truesight out to 60 feet as long as your spirit is within 100 feet of you.

Additionally, when you use your action to see through your spirit's senses, you are no longer deaf and blind with regard to your own senses, able to comprehend what happens in both perspectives simultaneously.

### Assuming Direct Control
At 18th level, when a creature fails its saving throw against your Invasive Presence feature, the target becomes charmed by you for as long as Invasive Presence is active.

While the target is charmed, you and your spirit have a telepathic link with it as long as you are within 100 feet of it. You and your spirit can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

## Path of the Corsair
There may come a time when a sentinel finds themselves stranded, hunted, or in any situation where they must hide their nature as a force wielder. Those sentinels who follow the Path of the Corsair make use of alternative weaponry not commonly associated with force-wielders to great effect.

### Scavenger's Reach
Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you learn the *force disarm* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and the target fails its save. Finally, when you cast the *force disarm* power, disarm a blaster weapon, and catch it, you can reload the weapon as a part of the same action.

### Corsair Weapons
Also at 3rd level, you can use the force to quickly learn the use of unfamiliar weapons. When you hold a weapon that you are not proficient in, you can spend 1 force point (no action required) to gain proficiency with that weapon until the end of your next long rest. Additionally, you can use your Force-Empowered Self options when you hit with a ranged weapon attack.

Lastly, when you throw a grenade, you can use Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength when determining your throwing range.

### Force-Empowered Detonators
At 7th level, you learn to infuse a number of small detonators with the Force. Over the course of a short or long rest, you can create a number of detonators equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). Your detonators can only be used by you, and they lose their potency at the end of your next short or long rest.

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can throw one of your detonators at a point within range. Your detonators have a range equal to 30 feet + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier x 5. Make a universal ranged force attack. On a hit, the detonator adheres to the target, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is pushed back 5 feet. On a miss, it falls to the ground. Hit or miss, the detonator then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw against your universal force save DC. If the detonator adhered to a target, the creature has disadvantage on the saving throw. A creature takes force damage using your Kinetic Combat die + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Energized Kinetics
By 13th level, once per turn, when you deal damage with a Force-Empowered Detonator or your Double Strike feature, you can deal additional damage using your Kinetic Combat die. The damage type is force, lightning, necrotic, or psychic (your choice).

### Disorienting Detonations
At 18th level, when a creature fails the saving throw against your Force-Empowered Detonators feature, you can spend 2 force points to subject it to the effects of one of the following force powers: *affliction, force blind/deafen, stun,* or *stun droid*. They automatically fail the saving throw for the selected power, but the effects only last until the end of your next turn.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/GSI1y6J.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:30px;right:25px;width:415px;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(-1)' />

## Path of Etherealness
In the distant reaches of the galaxy obscure knowledge and forgotten secrets of the Force can sometimes be found. While other Force-sensitive may find themselves touched by this secret knowledge of the Force, those sentinels who follow the Path of Etherealness instead find themselves grabbed. Held onto by mysterious aspects of the Force that refuse to let go, these sentinels find themselves able to manipulate the universe around them.

### Aberrant Resilience
Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you learn the *resistance* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use your Deflection and Slow Time Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action. Finally, this power no longer requires concentration for you when you target yourself with it, and the power's d4 increases to d6 at 5th level, d8 at 11th level, and d10 at 17th level.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Force-Empowered Kinesis
Also at 3rd level, your connection to the Force allows you to briefly become incorporeal. When you use a Force-Empowered Self feature, until the end of your turn, you can move through other creatures and objects as if they are difficult terrain. If you end this movement inside a solid object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved. This damage can't be reduced or negated in any way.

### Out of Touch
At 7th level, as an action, you can step out of sync with the rest of the universe for 1 minute. At the start of each of your turns, roll a d20. If you roll 11 or higher, you and everything your are wearing or carrying are completely invisible to all beings, except for those with truesight. On a roll of 10 or lower, you instead appear as an indistinguishably blurred form roughly your normal height and weight, though a being with truesight sees you normally. Regardless of your appearance, for the duration, your speed doubles, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you can move through creatures and objects willingly though you can not affect them and they can not affect you. You can end this feature early on your turn (no action required). When this effect ends, if you are inside a solid object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved. 

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Event Cascade
By 13th level, you have advantage on attack rolls you make against creatures if you haven't dealt damage to them or affected them with a force power since the start of your previous turn.

### Aberrant Self
At 18th level, you no longer suffer the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged abnormally. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water, and you no longer need to sleep. Lastly, the first time you take damage on each of your turns, you can roll your Kinetic Combat die and reduce the damage by that amount.

## Path of Synthesis
There is power in diversity unknown to those of narrow mind. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Synthesis blend their intricate mastery of the Force with their understanding of technology, creating unique effects to overcome their obstacles.

### Techcasting Secrets
Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you have learned to intersperse your training with an aptitude for technology. Choose two tech powers of 1st-level or lower. The chosen powers count as universal force powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the sentinel table. 

At 7th-level, you learn two tech powers of 2nd-level or lower. At 13th level, you learn two tech powers of 3rd-level or lower. At 17th level, you learn two tech powers of 4th-level or lower. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tech powers you know and replace it with another tech power of no higher than the level determined by this feature.

### Synthetic Understanding
Also at 3rd level, you've applied your newfound knowledge to broader pursuits. You gain proficiency in Technology or one tool of your choice.

Additionally, when you make an Intelligence (Technology) check, or a check with a tool, you may use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) instead of your Intelligence modifier.

Finally, when you deal damage with a tech power or your Double Strike Force Empowered Self option, you can choose to substitute the damage dealt as ion.

### Force-Empowered Tech
At 7th level, you learn to fully blend your technological aptitude with your use of the Force. You have three such effects: Disruption Pulse, Force Override, and Techcasting Insight. When you use your Force-Empowered Tech, you choose which effect to create.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Disruption Pulse
As an action, you can send out a 30 foot cone of electromagnetically-charged energy to overload enemy weapons. Each creature within the cone that is wearing or carrying a weapon with electric components must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the weapon is being worn, this save is made with disadvantage. On a failed save, the first attack they attempt to make with that weapon has disadvantage. A creature with multiple weapons must make a separate save for each weapon.

#### Forced Override
When you cast a tech power that requires a saving throw, you can impose disadvantage on the save (no action required).

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

#### Techcasting Insight
As an action, you can attempt to determine another creature's experience with techcasting. When you do so, you make an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Technology) check. If you succeed, you immediately learn the target's techcasting Max Power Level, as well as any tech powers currently affecting the target.

### Improved Force-Empowered Tech
By 13th level, you've gained access to two additional Force-Empowered Tech effects: Harmonic Synthesis and Conservation of Energy.

#### Harmonic Synthesis
When you use your action to cast a force power, you can use your bonus action to gain resistance to damage dealt by tech powers until the start of your next turn. If you use your action to cast a tech power, you can instead gain resistance to damage dealt by force powers.

#### Conservation of Energy
When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a tech power, you can reduce the force point cost of the tech power to 0 (no action required).

### Reflective Shield
At 18th level, when you use your Force-Empowered Tech features, a barrier for energy shimmers into existence, surrounding you until the end of your next turn. When you take damage, you can mitigate the incoming energy and potentially reflect it back at your attacker. You use your reaction to have resistance against the triggering damage, and if the<br> source of the damage is within 5<br> feet of you, they take half of<br> the total damage dealt<br> as ion.

## Path of Tenacity
The tenacious are ever mindful that the Force ebbs and flows, and uses this knowledge to great advantage. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Tenacity use their connection to the Force to draw the opposition's attention while also warding off their attacks, serving as an effective bulwark against even the most implacable of foes.

### Protector
Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you learn the *saber ward* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use your Deflection and Slow Time Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action. Finally, when you cast it, you can spend 2 force points to extend the benefits to creatures of your choice within 5 feet of you while the power is active. The creatures immediately lose this benefit if they move more than 5 feet away from you.

### Kinetic Ward
Also at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect a strike when you are dealt damage by a melee weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the<br><br><br><br> attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your sentinel level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can redirect it at another target if you have a weapon capable of doing so. You can spend 1 force point to make a melee weapon attack at a target within 5 feet of you with the weapon, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and if the attack hits it uses your Kinetic Combat die for its damage roll. If *saber ward* is active, you have advantage on the attack roll.

### Kinetic Bulwark
At 7th level, you can extend your Kinetic Ward to a creature within 5 feet of you when they are hit by a melee weapon attack. If this damage is not reduced to 0, the warded creature takes any remaining damage. 

### Indomitable
By 13th level, the Force flowing through you makes it harder for movement to be forced upon you. You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to avoid being grappled or moved. If you fail the saving throw or ability check, you can spend 1 force point to reroll one of the dice once. You must use the new roll.

Additionally, if allies within 5 feet of you are gaining the benefit of your *saber ward* force power, they also gain the benefit of this feature.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Kinetic Bastion
At 18th level, you can protect allies even further from you. When a creature within 30 feet of you is hit by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to teleport to them and extend your Kinetic Ward. If this damage is not reduced to 0, the warded creature takes any remaining damage. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Path of Witchcraft
The Force connects all living things. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Witchcraft use that connection to summon the aid of nature, both beasts and the elements, adapting them to their will.

### Bonus Proficiencies
You gain proficiency in the Animal Handling skill.

### Wild Power
Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you learn the *enfeeble* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and the target fails its save. Finally, you add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to damage rolls with it.

### Beast Companion
Also at 3rd level, you learn to create a powerful bond through the Force with your own personal beast companion.

Choose your beast, which is detailed at the end of this calling. Over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of herbs and food to call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your companion. 

If your beast dies, or you want to bond with a different creature, you must first break the bond with your current beast companion. You may only have one beast companion at a time.

Your beast gains a variety of benefits while it is bonded to you:
- The beast obeys your commands as best it can. It acts on your turn, and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your beast acts on its own.
- Your beast's level equals your sentinel level, and for each sentinel level you gain after 3rd, your beast companion gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly.
- Your beast has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level.
- Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature in this class, your beast's abilities also improve. Your beast can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your beast can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.

Additionally, while your beast companion is within 5 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:
- When you use a Force-Empowered Self option to increase your speed or armor class, you can instead grant this bonus to your beast companion. 
- You and your beast companion can communicate telepathically, though your beast companion can only communicate in and understand simple concepts.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

&emsp;This radius increases to 10 feet at 7th level, 20 feet at 13th level, and 30 feet at 18th level.

### Nature's Vigor
At 7th level, you've learned to attune your senses with nature. If you spend at least 1 minute meditating while in nature, you gain the following benefits for 1 hour:
- You ignore difficult terrain caused by nature.
- You can understand plants within 30 feet of you. They can telepathically communicate simple ideas to you, including memories from within the past day.
- You can command plants within 30 feet of you to create difficult terrain, or other tasks at the GM's discretion (no action required).

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Beastwarden
By 13th level, your bond with your beast companion strengthens, granting the following benefits while your beast companion is within 20 feet of you:
- When you cast a force power that targets only yourself, and your beast companion is within range, you can also target your beast companion with that power. 
- If you have darkvision and your beast doesn't, your beast gains it with the same radius. If your beast has darkvision and you don't, you gain it with the same radius. If you both have darkvision, you both use the larger radius, which then increases by 30 feet.
- If you have advantage on Perception checks and your beast doesn't, your beast gains advantage on Perception checks. If your beast has advantage on Perception checks and you don't, you gain advantage on Perception checks. If you both have advantage on Perception checks, when either of you makes a Perception check with advantage, you can reroll one of the dice once.

This radius increases to 30 feet at 18th level.

### Stormcaller
At 18th level, you've learned to command the elements to summon a fierce storm in a 30-foot radius around you. As an action, you can gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
- You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.
- You have resistance to energy, lightning, and necrotic damage.
- Whenever a hostile creature enters this radius or starts its turn there, it takes 10 lightning damage.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Generating Your Beast 
Choosing your beast companion is an integral part of being a Witchcraft Sentinel. Your beast takes a form of your choosing. Alternatively, your GM can choose what form your beast takes based on your environment. 

Once you've selected your type of beast, you assign your beast companion's ability scores. Your beast's Intelligence score is 6, and you assign its other ability scores using a limited standard array (16, 14, 14, 12, 10) as you see fit.
