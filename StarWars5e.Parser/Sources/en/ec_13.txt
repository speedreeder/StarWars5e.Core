_**Mental maneuver**_<br>
You can use an action to expend a superiority die. When you do so, choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage for each attack it makes until the start of your next turn.

You can expend one superiority die to make a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check as a bonus action, adding the superiority die to the check.

You can use a bonus action to expend a superiority die. When you do so, choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and on its turn must use its movement to move half its speed in a random direction.
