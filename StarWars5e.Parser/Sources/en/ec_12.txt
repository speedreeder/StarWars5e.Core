#### Adrenaline
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when a creature within range that you can see would roll initiative
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You infuse one creature within range with a jittery burst of power, speeding its senses and reactions to the point of near precognition. The creature makes its initiative check with advantage.

#### Aid Droid
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose one droid or construct that you can see within range. The target can immediately use its reaction to regain hit points equal to 1d6 + your techcasting ability modifier.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Alter Self
*2nd-level tech power*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour

You alter your form with tech. When you cast the power, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the power. While the power lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.

***Aquatic Adaptation.*** You adapt your body to an aquatic environment. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

***Change Appearance.*** You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species (an organic species cannot appear as a droid, or vice versa), though none of your statistics change. You can also alter your vocal cords, enabling you to speak a language you know, but otherwise would be incapable of speaking. You also can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this power to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the power, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.

***Natural Weapons.*** You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your damage die for your unarmed strikes increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8). Your unarmed strikes are considered enhanced and you have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with them.

#### Barrage
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You launch 4d6 tiny projectiles at up to four creatures you can see within range. The projectiles can be divided between the targets as desired. Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 1 kinetic damage per projectile, or half as much damage on a successful save.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, you launch an additional 1d6 projectiles and can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

#### Burst of Flame
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot line)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You expel a burst of flame in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide, originating from you. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Construct Droid
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You construct a droid, which is deployed in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This droid uses the Constructed Droid stat block. When you cast the power, choose a design: Probe, Pyro, or Battle. The droid resembles a Class IV droid, and the design determines certain traits in its stat block. The droid falls to pieces and disintegrates when it drops to 0 hit points or when the power ends.

The droid is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the droid shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your commands you issue through your tech focus (no action required). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

The droid is a valid target for the _tracker droid interface_ power. If that power is cast targeting the constructed droid, it only takes 1 minute to synchronize with the droid.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, use the higher level wherever the power’s level appears in the stat block.

>

#### Cryogenic Blow
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack during this power's duration, the attack deals an extra 1d6 cold damage to the target. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it gains a level of slowed for the duration. At the start of each of its turns, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Overcharge Tech.*** If you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Delayed Detonator
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** 1 round

Choose a point you can see within range. You launch a detonator at that point, which remains there until the start of your next turn, when it explodes, ending the power. You can also use your reaction at any point during the power's duration to cause the detonator to explode early. When the detonator explodes, each creature within 5 feet of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d8 fire damage and 1d8 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, you can launch an additional detonator at another point you can see within range for each slot level above 1st. The detonators all explode simultaneously. A creature in the area of more than one detonator when they explode is only affected once.

#### Detonator
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You launch a detonator at a creature. Make a ranged tech attack against a creature you can see within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 fire damage, and each creature within 5 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 fire damage.

This power's damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (2d6/2d4), 11th level (3d6/3d4), and 17th level (4d6/4d4).

#### Disassemble
_7th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

One constructed object up to 100 lbs. in weight that you touch falls to pieces, separating into its component parts. For instance, a vibrosword separates into a blade, handle, oscillator, and guard, while a hovercart collapses into a repulsor engine, bolts, and metal panels. If the object is being worn, carried, or operated by a creature, the creature can make an Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the item is unaffected.

#### Dismantle
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** Special
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You break or tear an unenhanced structure or object you touch that is not being worn or carried by a creature other than you. The break or tear can be up to 1 foot in any dimension. When cast this in this way, this power has a casting time of 1 minute.

Alternatively, you can touch a droid or construct when you cast this power. Make a melee tech attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 energy damage. When cast in this way, this power has a casting time of 1 action.

This power’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

#### Fabricate
_4th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
 
You convert raw materials into products of the same material.
For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, and clothes from bantha hide.

Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the power is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.

Creatures or enhanced items can't be created by this power. You also can't use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of tool used to craft such objects.

#### Fabricate Minor Trap
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius sphere)
- **Duration:** 24 hours, or until triggered

You ward a 30-foot radius sphere centered on you with a manually-operated trap. The trap is well disguised. Any creature that can’t see the area at the time the power is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your tech save DC to notice the trap before entering the area. Once after this power is cast, when a creature you can see enters or moves within the warded area, you can use your reaction to trigger the trap. The effect on the creature depends on the kind of trap you employ, which you choose when you cast this power. You can maintain a maximum number of instances of this power at once equal to your techcasting ability modifier.

***Blaster.*** This power creates a blaster turret which fires at the target when triggered. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 2d10 energy damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

***Pitfall.*** This power creates a 5-foot diameter, 15-foot deep pitfall in the ground beneath the creature when triggered, which must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature falls into the pitfall. On a success, the creature falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the pitfall. This pitfall cannot be created through manufactured terrain. Otherwise, the hole is well constructed and lasts even after the power's duration. Flying creatures avoid this trap.

***Snare.*** This power creates a snare of rope, wire, vine, or webs that entangle the creature. The creature must make a Strength saving throw. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 kinetic damage and is restrained until the start of its next turn. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and ends its movement.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the effects increase, based on the trap.
*Blaster.* The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st. If cast using a slot of 3rd level or higher, this power targets creatures in a sphere centered on the triggering creature within the warded area, the radius of which is 5 feet for every two slot levels above 1st.
*Pitfall.* The depth of the pitfall increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 1st. If cast using a slot of 3rd level or higher, the diameter of the pit is 5 feet wider for every two slot levels above 1st.
*Snare.* The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st. If cast using a slot of 3rd level or higher, Large creatures no longer have advantage on their saving throw. This size category increases for every two slot levels above 1st.

#### Greater Energy Shield
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when a creature you can see within range is hit by an attack or targeted by the *homing rockets* power
- **Range:** 15 feet
- **Duration:** 1 round

An energy shield appears and protects the target. Until the start of the target's next turn, the target has a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and the target takes no damage from *homing rockets*.

#### Instant Translocation
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Your form shimmers in a holographic configuration and collapses as an attack begins to hit you. You have a +5 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. As part of the same reaction, you can then teleport to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you, and can make one weapon attack with advantage against the attacker.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the maximum teleport distance increases by 10 for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Irradiate
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A surge of radiation washes over a creature within range. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d10 necrotic damage and suffers one level of exhaustion, which lasts for the duration. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and does not suffer a level of exhaustion. A creature exhausted by this power can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the power ends.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Itemize
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You instantly learn the exact quantity of one type of item within 30 feet of you. It must be a type of item that you've handled in the past; you can't, for example, use *itemize* to find out how many *BKGs* are nearby if you've never handled such a weapon. The object being itemized must also be reasonably specific. You can learn how many meilooruns are nearby, for example, but not how much fruit.

#### Jump
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You touch a creature. The creature's jump distance is tripled until the power ends.

#### Jump Jet
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You boost yourself through the air with a brief surge of repulsor energy. You can rise a number of feet equal to 20 x your techcasting ability modifier. You can also move a number of feet horizontally during any part of the movement equal to 5 x your techcasting ability modifier. At the end of the turn on which you cast this power, you float gently to the ground if you are still aloft.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, you can rise an additional 20 feet, and move horizontally by another 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.

#### Jump Pad
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a bouncy surface in a 5-foot square on a surface within range. When you cast the power, you can designate creatures that can safely use the jump pad. For the duration, whenever a creature you haven't chosen enters the affected area, it must make a Dexterity saving throw or be launched 10 feet upwards, and 5 feet horizontally in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face.

While a creature you have chosen (or a creature that has succeeded its Dexterity saving throw) is in the area, it can use its reaction to jump with the aid of the bouncy surface. The creature's jump distance for this jump is multiplied by 5.

#### Lesser Mislead
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 round

You become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts until the end of your next turn, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a power.

You can use your action to move your illusory double up to your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.

As soon as it is attacked or would take damage, the double dissipates.

#### Mutate/Augment
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You alter your body with tech, temporarily gaining new properties which last for the duration. You can select three of the following properties. You cannot select a property more than once, unless that property says otherwise.
- Your body becomes more flexible. You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws against effects that would grapple or restrain you, and your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain or squeezing.
- You grow one additional appendage. This appendage serves as an arm and a hand, though it can take the shape of a limb, tentacle, or similar appendage. You can select this property twice to grow a maximum number of two appendages. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required).
- You sprout antennae that give you tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.
- You extend the length of your limbs. When you make a melee attack or attempt to grapple, shove, or trip a creature on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.
- You gain a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed.
- Your flesh hardens. Your AC can't be less than 16, regardless of what kind of armor you're wearing.
- You can gain the benefits of any one option of the _alter self_ power. You can select this property multiple times to gain the benefits of multiple options of the _alter self_ power, choosing a different option each time.
- You gain the effect of the _magnetic hold_ power, but you can affix to and move along any surface, instead of only metallic surfaces. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
- You can gain any one effect of the _force enlightenment_ power.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, you can select an additional property for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Production Values
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You cause a minor effect within range. Choose one of the following:
- Your natural voice booms up to three times louder than normal for 1 minute. You can also alter the sound of your voice to achieve a certain effect--to sound more intimidating, for example.
- You cause unenhanced electronic lights to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.
- You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.
- You create a sound within range for up to 1 minute. The sound can range in volume from a whisper to a scream.
- You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.
- You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.
- You create an illusory image of an object no larger than a 5 foot cube. The illusion is purely visual.

If you cast this power multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

A creature that witnesses the effects of this power can use its action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. On a successful check, the creature discerns that the effects are illusory, and they become faint to the creature.

The maximum number of active effects increases by 3 when you reach 5th level (6), 11th level (9), and 17th level (12).

#### Skill Protocol
_5th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You enhance a droid or construct's protocols. You touch one willing droid or construct and give it expertise in one tool or skill of your choice.

You must choose a tool or skill in which the target is proficient and that isn't already benefiting from an effect, such as expertise, that doubles its proficiency bonus.

#### Spectrum Discharge
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a willing creature, granting it an elemental charge. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison or sonic. For the duration, a creature can use an action to expel energy of the chosen type in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Stinger
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** 1 round

You fire a stinging dart at a creature within range. Make a ranged tech attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 poison damage, and if the target is a humanoid or beast, it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn.

This power's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

#### Squad Shield
_7th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take in response to an incoming threat
- **Range:** Self (10-foot radius)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

In the face of danger, you create a barrier that protects you and those around you. A faintly glowing sphere of protection with a radius of 10 feet appears. The sphere lasts for the duration.

Any tech power (or force power that deals energy or lightning damage) of 7th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the power is cast using a higher level tech slot. Such a power can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the power has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such powers.

Furthermore, hazards of the following types cannot physically pass through the barrier or affect anything within it.

- Physical or energy projectiles.
- A specific effect, such as a thermal detonator's explosion.
- An environmental danger, such as falling rocks or a lava flow.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 8th level or higher, the maximum radius increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 7th. In addition, the barrier blocks powers of one level higher for each slot level above 7th.

#### Time Bomb
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Make a melee tech attack against a target you touch. On a miss, this power ends. On a hit, you deal 2d6 kinetic damage as you plant an explosive charge on the target's body. You can then detonate the charge as a bonus action, which ends this power. It deals 1d8 fire damage if detonated on the same turn. It deals 2d8 fire damage on your next turn, increasing by 1d8 for each round you do not detonate it, to a maximum of 6d8. If this power ends before you detonate the charge, the target takes no fire damage.

A creature affected by this power can use an action to attempt to remove the detonator from its person, making a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature chooses the ability to use) against your tech save DC. On a success, this power ends, as the detonator deactivates harmlessly.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the kinetic damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Transposition
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Another creature you can see within range has its form shimmer in a holographic configuration before collapsing. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (the target can choose to fail), or the target is teleported to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The chosen space must be on a surface or in a liquid that can support the target without the target having to squeeze.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the range of the power increases by 30 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Tri-Shot
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose up to three creatures within range, none of whom can be more than 10 feet apart. If you choose three creatures, each target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 energy damage. If you choose two creatures, each target takes 1d6 energy damage on a failed save instead. If you choose only one creature, the target takes 1d8 energy damage on a failed save.

This power's damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (two dice), 11th level (three dice), and 17th level (four dice).

#### Tune-up
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Up to six droids or constructs of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your techcasting ability modifier.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Warp Strike
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Varies
- **Duration:** 1 round

As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within your reach, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, and you can teleport to an unoccupied space of your choice within 10 feet of you. If you teleport to a space within 5 feet of the target, the target cannot take reactions until the end of its next turn.

This power’s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d6 energy damage to the target. This extra energy damage increases to 2d6 at 11th level and 3d6 at 17th level.

#### Wire Tow
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You project a length of wire towards a foe to bring them within your grasp. Make a ranged tech attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 kinetic damage, and you can pull it up to 25 feet closer to you. If you score a critical hit, the target is also knocked prone. If the target ends this movement within 5 feet of you and is no more than one size larger than you, the target is grappled by you for the duration.

If a creature you grapple with this power uses its action to escape, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your tech save DC to do so.

This power ends if the attack misses or the grapple ends.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
