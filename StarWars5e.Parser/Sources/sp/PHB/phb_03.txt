<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/TP83mUX.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:35px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">dventurers are extraordinary people, driven by a thirst</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for excitement into a life that others would never dare lead. They are heroes, compelled to explore the dark places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser women and men can't stand against. 

Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It's more than a profession; it's your character's calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the galaxy. A fighter, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A consular, by contrast, might see himself as a willing servant of the Force. While the fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the consular might know a number of Jedi or Sith who share his faith.

Your class gives you a variety of special features, such as a fighter's mastery of weapons and armor, and an engineer's powers. At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more and your existing features often improve. Each class entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, and a detailed explanation of each one.

\columnbreak

Adventurers sometimes advance in more than one class. An operative might switch direction in life and become an engineer. A berserker might discover latent force sensitivity and dabble in the guardian class while continuing to advance as a berserker. Sith purebloods are known to combine martial mastery with force training and advance as fighters and consulars simultaneously. Optional rules for combining classes in this way, called multiclassing, appear in chapter 6.

> Many classes and archetypes add material costs to obtain features integral to the class while most others don't. Your GM can choose to waive the time and cost component if they choose to do so.
>
> Additionally, certain classes and subclasses will often find themselves with a singular force or tech point, with which they can do nothing. Any character with the force- or tech-casting feature also gains the following feature:
> 
> When you fail an ability check, if you added your proficiency bonus to the check and you did not have advantage or disadvantage, you can spend 1 force or tech point to reroll the die. You can only use this feature once per ability check, and you must use the new roll.

Choose from the following class options:

## Berserker
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">A massive wookiee hunter prowls through the forest, hefting</span> his vibroaxe. With a roar he charges at the pair of trandoshans who dared poach his kin. 

A gamorrean snarls at the latest challenger to his authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with his bare hands as he did to the last six rivals. 

Frothing at the mouth, a nikto slams his helmet into the face of his foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.

These berserkers, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For every berserker, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.
  
<div style='margin-top:34px'></div>

### Primal Instinct
People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of<br> superiority. To a berserker, though,<br> civilization is no virtue, but a sign<br> of weakness. The strong embrace their<br> animal nature keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Berserkers are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive where the civilized don't.

Berserkers come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A berserker can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.
  
<div style='margin-top:105px'></div>

### A Life of Danger
Not every person deemed "berserkers" by scions of civilized society has the berserker class. A true berserker among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Berserkers charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.

Their courage in the face of danger makes berserkers perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a berserker. Some berserkers miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.

### Creating a Berserker
When creating a berserker character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your GM about an appropriate origin for your berserker. Did you come from a remote planet, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where berserkers are common?

What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled planets by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to "civilized" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.

#### Quick Build
You can make a berserker quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the mercenary background.

### Rage
Beginning at 1st level, in battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action if you aren't wearing heavy armor.

While raging, you gain the following benefits:
- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a berserker, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the berserker table.
- You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage.

If you are able to cast powers, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious, you don heavy armor, or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature or taken damage since your last turn. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your berserker level in the Rages column of the berserker table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.

### Unarmored Defense
Also at 1st level, while you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

### Reckless Attack 
Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

### Danger Sense
At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and powers. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

### Fighting Style
At 3rd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the Fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Berserker Approach
Also at 3rd level, you choose an approach that shapes the nature of your rage which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

\columnbreak

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Fast Movement
Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.

### Feral Instinct
By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the start of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

### Brutal Critical
Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

### Relentless Rage
Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

### Persistent Rage
Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.

### Indomitable Might
Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

### Primal Champion
At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores increases by 4. 

## Berserker Approaches
For berserkers, rage is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Your approach grants you features at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

## Augmented Approach
The Augmented Approach is for those who seek to increase their prowess through cybernetic enhancement. Some who take this path go so far they are left with little more than the memory of the body they once owned, all to achieve in combat what they cannot with a body made of flesh and bone.

### Basic Cybernetics
When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you learn the *mending* and *analyse* tech powers and can cast them without the use of a wristpad or spending tech points. You can cast *analyse* this way a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Overdrive Enhancement
Also at 3rd level, you gain a cybernetic enhancement. Choose one of the following enhancements and gain its feature. You must undergo cybernetic surgery by a person proficient in biotech's implements that incorporates this enhancement into your body. This surgery costs 100 credits and takes 8 hours.

#### Dermal Armor
While raging you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage.

#### Morbid Protrusions
While raging, your unarmed strike deals 1d4 + Strength modifier kinetic damage and when you take the Attack action and attack with a melee weapon or unarmed strike, you can use a bonus action to make an unarmed attack. 

This unarmed attack die increases to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 11th level, and 1d10 at 17th level.

#### Pressurised Limbs
While raging, you can use your bonus action to leap up to 30 feet to an empty space you can see. When you land you deal kinetic damage equal to your Strength modifier to each creature within 5 feet of where you land. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Consitution modifier (minimum of one). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

#### Twitchlock Actuators
While you're raging, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, you can also use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.

### Support Enhancement
At 6th level you gain an additional cybernetic enhancement. Choose one of the following enhancements and gain its feature. You must undergo cybernetic surgery by a person proficient in biotech's implements that incorporates this enhancement into your body. This surgery costs 600 credits and takes 8 hours.

#### Body Sculpting
You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice from Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Sleight of Hand.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

#### Holdout Cavity
You have a shielded compartment built into your body that can be used to store and hide a light weapon or item of similar size.

#### Krykna Anchors
You gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed.

#### Panspectral Optics
You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty. You are able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.

#### Support Structure
Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled and you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.

### More Machine than Man
Starting at 10th level, your cybernetics allow you to become immune to poison and disease. Additionally, you ignore unenhanced difficult terrain.

### Final Enhancement
At 14th level you gain a final cybernetic enhancement. Choose one of the following enhancements and gain its feature. You must undergo cybernetic surgery by a person proficient in biotech's implements that incorporates this enhancement into your body. This surgery costs 2000 credits and takes 8 hours.

#### Holoskin Emitters
While you're raging any creature within 5 feet of you that's hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.

#### Hydraulic Overrides
While you're raging you can use a bonus action on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone when you hit it with melee weapon attack.

#### Integrated Boosters
While raging you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.

#### Ysalamir Capacitor Mesh
When you are forced to make a saving throw against a force power, you can immediately use your reaction to move up to half your speed towards the source power's caster. If you end this movement within 5 feet of the target, you can immediately make one melee weapon attack against the target as a part of that reaction.

## Marauder Approach
Few things are more terrifying than being in the path of a Berserker who has learned the ways of the Force. Those who follow this path unlock something deep within them, a well of untamed power from the depths of their fury. When a marauder unleashes their rage, they channel their brute strength into primal might, and uses it to devastate his foes in a hail of fire, blades, and blood. Due to the uncontrolled nature of their powers, marauders have a dangerous predilection for the strength and raw power offered by the dark side, and many fall into it's clutches. Even those who do not are always temped by the voices of fury barely contained within.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Forcecasting
When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you have derived powers from your primal connection to the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

#### Force Powers Known
You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

#### Force Points
You have a number of force points equal to your berserker level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table.

You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

#### Forcecasting Ability
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___

<div align="center">

**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your forcecasting ability modifier

___

**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br>your forcecasting ability modifier

</div>

___

### Furious Force
Also at 3rd level, you can cast force powers while raging as long as the power's casting time is no more than 1 action, the power does not require concentration, and you are not wearing heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield. While raging, you add your rage damage to damage rolls from force powers you cast. If a force power damages more than one target, you may only apply your rage damage to one of the targets. 

Casting force powers during rage counts as attacking for the purposes of maintaining rage, and you can use your Reckless Attack feature to gain advantage when casting a force power that requires an attack roll.

### Reckless Power
At 6th level, weapons and the force are equally an extension of your rage. While you are raging and you use your action to cast a force power, you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action.

### Powerful Presence
Starting at 10th level, as a bonus action, you unleash a battle cry infused with force energy. Choose up to ten other creatures of  within 60 feet of you that can hear you. Friendly creatures have advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn, and hostile creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of your next turn.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Force Storm
At 14th level, you can expel the might of your rage all at once to unleash a devastating storm of force energy. As an action, you can end your rage early, forcing each creature within 15 feet of you to make a Dexterity saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d12 force damage for each round you've spent in rage, or half as much on a successful one.

## Warchief Approach
For some berserkers, it is their duty or birthright to lead their tribe and kin to battle and victory. The Warchief Approach is one forged from alliances, bonds, and strategy. In combat, your rages are less mindless, and more focused. Ignoring the distractions of unimportant events, your attention hones in on the battlefield and how best to direct and control it. You guide your allies' strikes, and your presence is enough to wash away their fatigue.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Savage Diplomat
Your path necessitates that you build relationships with others, for the betterment of your tribe or yourself. 

When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Persuasion or Intimidation. You can choose to learn one language in place of the skill proficiency.

### Commanding Rage
Also at 3rd level, when in your rage, you become more aware of your allies, and their intent when fighting at your side. While you are raging, when an ally within 10 feet of you makes an attack roll against an enemy, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack and add your rage damage bonus to the damage roll, if<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the attack hits.

### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Inspiring Presence
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;At 6th level your mere presence on the<br> &emsp;&emsp;battlefield rallies your allies. When you rage,<br> &emsp;choose up to 3 allies that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature gains temporary hit points equal to half your berserker level (rounded down) + your Charisma modifier (minimum of one).

### Raid Planning
Starting at 10th level, you learn to flare up your allies' drive for combat, urging them to follow you into the fray. During a long rest, you tell sagas, sing battle songs, and give inspiring speeches. At the end of the long rest choose up to 5 creatures that can hear and understand you (which can include yourself) to add your Charisma modifier (minimum of one) to their next initiative roll, and a 10 foot bonus to their speed on their first turn of combat.

### War Chant
By 14th level you have memorized the litanies, songs, and chants of your people and their dedication to war. When you enter a rage you can take a commanding stance. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you have a special reaction you can take on a number of allies' turns equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You can only use this special reaction to use your Commanding Rage feature.

Additionally, during this rage, when an enemy within 10 feet of you makes an attack roll against an ally, you can use your reaction to reduce that roll by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

## Consular
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">A twi'lek in black robes steps on a terrified rodian, who </span> scampers away on the ground. Lightning sparks from his fingers, illuminating his red and black tattoos. The rodian's pleas for mercy fall on deaf ears as the Sith channels his lightning into his failed apprentice, leaving nothing but a charred husk behind.

Sitting cross-legged on a dense patch of grass, a miraluka mystic meditates on the Force. With every breath, the trees sway with a rhythmic breeze. Though she lacks simple vision, she can see the Force as it moves everything around her. 

A drably-robed human focuses inward, channeling the Force into the ground around him. Slowly, all the debris within arms reach rises into the air around him; with a flick of his wrist, he clears the air, sending his projectiles to pound on the approaching tank.

Consulars are the supreme wielders of the Force, defined and united by the powers they cast. Drawing on the omnipresent Force that permeates the universe, consulars cast powers of rejuvenating healing and destructive lightning, draining life-force and manipulating minds; the most powerful with the Force can even experience brief glimpses of the future. 

<div style='margin-top:175px'></div>

### Strong with the Force
Refraining from drawing their lightsabers except as a measure of last resort, consulars spend a great deal of time studying the mysteries of the Force. Their knowledge allows them to channel the Force to greater heights, unlocking unrivaled power, and twisting those powers to greater effect. 

<div style='margin-top:175px'></div>

### Sage or Sorcerer
Consulars who follow the light side of the Force, using their powers to better their communities and people, are often called sages, while consulars who fall to the dark side and subjugate or cast aside all in their path are commonly called sorcerers. Alternatively, they may tend toward the middle, refraining from politics and war, spending their time in isolation and study.

### Creating a Consular
While creating your consular, consider your personal philosophy in regards to the Force and its most famous practitioners – the Jedi and the Sith. Are you a member of one of the two orders, or do you walk a different path? Perhaps you were ostracized from your primitive village out of superstition or jealousy. You may have been brutally trained from a young age in the dark side, fueling your innate thirst for power, or perhaps you were trained as a padawan in one of the Jedi temples. How do you treat strangers, and how do they treat you once they know your abilities? What was your family like, or what did you have instead of a family? Do you see the Force as light and dark, or an impartial river of gray? 

#### Quick Build
You can make a consular quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Wisdom or Charisma your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the Jedi or Sith background.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Forcecasting
Beginning at 1st level, in your meditations on the force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

#### Force Powers Known
You learn 8 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the consular table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

#### Force Points
You have a number of force points equal to your consular level x 4, as shown in the Force Points column of the consular table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the consular table.

You may only cast force powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

#### Forcecasting Ability
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___

<div align="center">

**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your forcecasting ability modifier

___

**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br>your forcecasting ability modifier

</div>

___

### Force Recovery
Also at 1st level, you have learned to regain some of your energy by briefly meditating. When you finish a short rest, you can regain a number of force points equal to half your consular level (rounded down) + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

\columnbreak

### Force-Empowered Casting
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to twist your powers to suit your needs. When you cast a force power, you can expend additional force points to modify the power. You gain two of the following Empowerment options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.

You can use only one Empowerment option on a power when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

#### Careful Power
When you cast a power that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the power's full force. To do so, you spend 1 additional force point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the power.

#### Distant Power
When you cast a power that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 additional force point to double the range of the power.

When you cast a power that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 additional force point to make the range of the power 30 feet.

#### Extended Power
When you cast a power that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 additional force point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

#### Heightened Power
When you cast a power that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 additional force points to give one target of the power disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the power.

#### Improved Power
When you roll damage for a power, you can spend 1 additional force point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Improved Power even if you have already used a different Empowerment option during the casting of the power.

#### Lingering Power
When you cast a power that requires concentration to maintain you can choose to spend 3 additional force points. If you do, when you lose concentration on the power, the power will not end until the end of your next turn.

#### Pinpoint Power 
When you cast a power that allows you to force creatures in an area to make a saving throw you can instead spend 1 force point and make a ranged force attack against a single target that would be in the range. On a hit the target suffers the effects as though they failed their saving throw.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

#### Quickened Power
When you cast a power that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 additional force points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

#### Refocused Power 
When you are forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a power you can use your reaction and spend 2 force points to automatically succeed on the saving throw. You can use this option even if you have already used a different Empowerment option during the casting of the power. 

#### Twinned Power
When you cast a power that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of additional force points equal to the power's level to target a second creature in range with the same power (1 force point if the power is at-will).

### Force Shield
Also at 2nd level, you learn how to defend yourself purely through your strength with the Force. When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to shroud yourself in Force energy. Until the start of your next turn, you have a bonus to AC equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of +1). This includes the triggering attack.

You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 11th, and 17th level in this class. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

\columnbreak

### Force Affinity
When you reach 3rd level, you've developed an affinity for one of the three aspects of the Force: the Ashla, the Bendu, or the Bogan. Choose one from the following:

#### Ashla
When you successfully cast a light side power, either your or the target's (your choice) hit point maximum and current hit points increase by an amount equal to the power's level. This effect lasts for 1 minute. You can only have one instance of this effect active at a time.

#### Bendu
You can add both your Wisdom and Charisma modifier to your maximum number of force points, instead of just one.

#### Bogan
When you roll a 1 on a damage die for a dark side power, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1. 

### Consular Tradition
Also at 3rd level, you choose a consular tradition, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).

### One with the Force
At 20th level, your attunement to the Force is absolute. Your Wisdom or Charisma score increases by 4, and your maximum for this score increases by 4. Additionally, you gain mastery over a single force power, and can cast it with little effort. Choose one 3rd-level force power that you know as your signature power. You can cast it once at 3rd level without expending force points. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

&emsp;If you want to cast it at a higher level, you must<br> &emsp;&emsp;expend force points as normal.

## &nbsp;Consular Traditions
Different consulars select different traditions, called Ways, to follow as they hone their powers. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.

\pagebreakNum

## Way of Balance
There is serenity in balance, and no one knows this better than the consular. Those consulars who follow the Way of Balance focus on utilizing the Force to equalize the battlefield. They bend the Force to shield their allies and expose their foes.

### Force Barrier
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can weave the Force around yourself for protection. When you cast a universal power of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously manipulate the Force to create a barrier on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The barrier has hit points equal to twice your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). Your barrier can never have hit points<br> greater than twice your consular level +<br> your Wisdom or Charisma modifier<br> (your choice).

Whenever you take damage, the barrier<br> takes the damage instead. If this damage<br> reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, you take<br> any remaining damage.

While the barrier has 0 hit points, it can't<br> absorb damage, but its power remains.<br> Whenever you cast a universal power of 1st level or higher, the barrier regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the power.

Once you create the barrier, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.

### Projected Barrier
At 6th level, when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Force Barrier to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage.

### At-Will Barrier
Beginning at 10th level, your at-will universal powers grant a small boost to your Force Barrier. When you cast an at-will universal power, the barrier regains 1 hit point.

### Improved Suppression
At 14th level, when you cast a force power that requires you to make an ability check as a part of casting that power, such as *sever force* or *force suppression*, you add your proficiency bonus to that ability check.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Force Resistance
Starting at 18th level, you have advantage on saving throws against force powers. Additionally, you have resistance against the damage of force powers.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/KuUWgUr.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:-100px;right:-380px;width:1063px;transform:scaleX(-1);z-index:1000;' />

## Way of Lightning
Of all of the dark arts of the Force, little can match the spectacle and devastation of Force lightning. Those consulars who follow the Way of Lightning summon intense discharges of pure Force energy, overwhelming enemies with punishing damage from a distance, leaving them shaken and vulnerable -- if not dead.

### Shocking Affinity
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, when you cast a force power that deals lightning damage, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it.

Additionally, when you cast a damage dealing force power that requires an attack roll or saving throw, you can cause that power to instead deal lightning damage. If the power would call for a saving throw other than Dexterity, it instead calls for a Dexterity saving throw. If 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

you hit with the power, or the target fails the power's saving throw, affected creatures become *shocked* until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

### Potent Lightning
At 6th level you add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of +1) to any damage you deal with force powers that deal lightning damage.

### Blistering Rebuke
Beginning at 10th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 plus your consular level lightning damage, is pushed back 10 feet, and becomes *shocked* until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't moved or *shocked*.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Electric Attunement
At 14th level, you gain resistance to lightning damage. Additionally, force powers you cast ignore resistance to lightning damage.

### Unlimited Power
Starting at 18th level, you can increase the power of your simpler lightning force powers. When you cast a<br> &emsp;&emsp;force power of 6th-level or lower that deals<br> &emsp;&emsp;lightning damage, you can deal maximum damage<br> &emsp;&emsp;with that power.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You can use this feature with no adverse<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;effects a number of times equal to<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;choice, a minimum of once). If you use<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;this feature beyond this before you finish a long<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;level of the power, immediately after you cast<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;it. Each time you use this feature again<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;before finishing a long rest, the necrotic<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;damage per power level increases by<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1d12. This damage can not<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;be reduced in any way.

## Way of the Sage
The rejuvenating power of the Force is incredible, and the consular is the master of this usage. Those consulars who follow the Way of the Sage assist with an array of healing powers that grant allies the strength to continue through even the harshest of encounters. Separated from the heart of the fray, the sage can be an unfailing warden to those in need.

### Disciple of Life
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, when you cast a force power that restores hit points, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it. 

Additionally, whenever you use a power of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the power's level.

### Preserve Life
At 6th level, as an action, you can channel the Force and evoke healing energy that restores a number of hit points equal to five times your consular level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier<br> (your choice, a minimum of<br> once). You regain all<br> expended uses when you<br> finish a long rest.

### Blessed Healer
Beginning at 10th level, the healing<br> powers you cast on others heal you<br> as well. When you cast a force power<br> that restores hit points to a creature<br> other than you, you regain hit points<br> equal to 2 + the power's level.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Blessed by the Force
At 14th level you gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries. As a bonus action when you have fewer than half of your hit points remaining, you can regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Supreme Healing
Starting at 18th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a power, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.

## Engineer
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Flinching occasionally as a blaster bolt hits the nearby</span> bulkhead, a Sullustan mechanic quickly solders a large wire. He peers through his tinted goggles, ignoring the shouts of his ship captain as the enemy descends on the hanger. Finally he shouts with pride as the repaired coupling powers up, causing the frigate to hum with energy. He gathers his tools and runs into the ship moments before it finally takes off. 

Inside, the human captain jumps into the cockpit. She nods to her droid co-pilot, who quickly begins charting a course home. Before the calculations can<br> be completed, enemy Starfighters scream in from the clouds. The pilot rolls the ship, nimbly evading incoming fire. She reroutes the power to shields, leaving just enough for astronavigation. Just as the energy reserves near depletion, the exosphere and stars beyond blur into streaks of light. In a flash, they warp to safety. 

A Cerean officer surveys the battlefield, looking for weaknesses. When he identifies a potential problem, he keys in a quick combination in his wristpad. In a blink, a custom suit of armor assembles itself around him. As the helmet locks into place, the officer leaps into the air, flying overhead and raining destruction on the opposition.

Every machine needs an engineer to run it, and a living crew is no different. Engineers are the experts and professionals who rely on skill, bravery, and their tools to survive and keep others alive. While they do not claim to be fighters, their mere presence can turn the tide of battle or simply keep operations running.

<div style='margin-top:100px'></div>

### Behind the Curtain
While perhaps not as intimidating as a heavily-armored trooper, or as exotic as a lighsaber-wielding guardian, engineers are no less vital to group dynamic. They are armorers and gunsmiths, electricians and welders, or any other facet to be found in facilities across the galaxy. Their work, often unsung, is what keeps starships (and their crew) intact.

<div style='margin-top:100px'></div>

### Unflappable
It takes bravery for a soldier to enter a battlefield. It perhaps takes more for someone who is unarmed, and untrained in combat, to do the same. Engineers put their lives on the line for a living, whether by choice or acknowledging their plights as an occupational hazard. Whether they come from an elite training academy or learned their talents surviving in the slums, they are no strangers to danger and conflict.

### Creating an Engineer
While creating your engineer character, consider what your primary skill set is and how you use it. You could be a street-smart mechanic who taught yourself how to fix swoop bikes as a teenager. Perhaps you are the recent graduate of an esteemed medical college, or a rookie pilot in the fledgling Rebel Alliance. What is the number one skill you are known for? Why are you willing to enter battles when you have no combat training? How do you view the more adventurous members of your group, and how do they see you and your role?

#### Quick Build
You can make an engineer quickly by following these<br> suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest<br> ability score. Your next-highest score should be<br> Constitution. Second, choose the scientist<br> background.

\pagebreakNum

### Techcasting
Beginning at 1st level, during your training you have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.

#### Tech Powers Known
You learn 6 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the engineer table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.

#### Tech Points
You have a number of tech points equal to your engineer level x 2, as shown in the Tech Points column of the engineer table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the engineer table.

You may only cast tech powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

#### Techcasting Ability
Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___

<div align="center">

**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Intelligence modifier

___

**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br>your Intelligence modifier

</div>

___

#### Techcasting Focus
You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) or your tool proficiencies granted by this class as a techcasting focus for your tech powers.

### Potent Aptitude
Also at 1st level, your technological experience lends you an uncommon insight that you can use to bolster your allies. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Potent Aptitude die, a d4. This die changes as you gain engineer levels, as shown in the Potent Aptitude column of the engineer table.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

deciding to use the Potent Aptitude die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Potent Aptitude die is rolled, it is lost.

A creature can have only one Potent Aptitude die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Infuse Item
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to temporarily enhance a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one unenhanced object that is a suit of armor or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes an enhanced item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon. 
Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 15th level.

### Tool Expertise
Also at 2nd level, you gain expertise in any tool proficiencies you gain from this class.

### Engineering Discipline
Starting at 3rd level, you begin to focus on a specific engineering discipline, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your discipline grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).

### Quick Thinking
Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Potent Aptitude when you finish a short or long rest.

### Tech Mastery
At 20th level, your mastery of technology is unrivaled. Your Constitution and Intelligence scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.

Additionally, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Potent Aptitude left, you regain one use.

## Engineering Disciplines
The wide range of tool applications gives birth to well defined distinctions between different engineering disciplines. Each discipline focuses on maximizing the personal use of a certain tool. Your discipline grants you features at 3rd, 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

### Modified Armor
Also at 3rd level, you learn to modify one unenhanced suit of armor or shield utilizing your armormech knowledge. Over the course of a long rest, you can expend materials equal to half the cost of the armor in order to modify it. You must have the armor, materials, and armormech's implements in order to perform this modification.

Your modified armor is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified armor has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.

At 9th level, you can maintain both a modified suit of armor and shield. Each modified item has modification slots as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table.

### Damage Absorption
Lastly at 3rd level, when you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to absorb some of that damage. When<br> you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by the amount rolled on the die + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

### Armormech's Celerity
Beginning at 6th level, when you take the Attack action, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

You can use this feature a number of times<br> equal to your Intelligence modifier (a<br> minimum of once). You regain all<br> expended uses when you<br> complete a long rest.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Casting Celerity
At 14th level, when you use your action to a cast a tech power, you can use your Armormech's Celerity feature.

### Suit Reliability
Starting at 18th level, your suit is like a second skin. Whenever you make an ability check or saving throw that uses Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. You must be wearing your modified armor to gain this benefit.

## Astrotech Engineering
Those engineers who choose the Astrotech Engineering discipline focus on crafting and upgrading their droid companions.

### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this discipline at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in astrotech's implements. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with astrotech's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.

### Droid Companion
Also at 3rd level, you learn to employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to create and customize your own personalized droid companion.

Choose your droid, which is detailed at the end of this discipline. Over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of materials to finally finish your droid.

If your droid is irreparably destroyed, or you want to interface with a different droid, you can spend an additional 250 credits and 1 hour to change the target of this feature. You may only have one droid companion at a time.

Your droid gains a variety of benefits while it is interfaced with you:
- The droid obeys your commands as best it can. It acts on your turn, and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your droid acts on its own.
- Your droid's level equals your engineer level, and for each engineer level you gain after 3rd, your droid companion gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly.
- Your droid has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level.
- Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature in this class, your droid's abilities also improve. Your droid can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your droid can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.
- Your droid can not wear armor, but you can have the armor professionally integrated into its chassis. Over the course of a long rest, you can expend materials equal to half the cost of the armor in order to integrate it into your droid. Your droid must be proficient in armor in order to have it integrated.
- Your droid is a valid target of the *tracker droid interface* tech power.

Additionally, you can modify your droid. Your droid companion has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

### Potent Integration
Lastly at 3rd level, when your droid makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to give it a boost. Roll the die and add it to both the attack and damage rolls, if the attack hits.

### Coordinated Attack
Beginning at 6th level, when you take the Attack action, if your companion can see you, it can use its reaction to make a weapon attack against the same creature.

### Droid Defense
At 14th level, while your droid can see you, it has advantage on all saving throws.

### Superior Droid Defense
Starting at 18th level, whenever an<br> attacker that your droid can see<br> hits it with an attack, it can use<br> its reaction to halve the attack's<br> damage against it.

## Fighter
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">A Trandoshan runs frantically across rooftops, constantly</span> looking over his shoulder. As he prepares to leap a gap, a blaster bolt hits him in the back and renders<br> him unconscious. His blurry vision barely<br> makes out the figure of a masked woman<br> who casually approaches, ready to collect her<br> bounty.

With his muscular arms held wide, a<br> grizzled-looking Wookiee grins to his<br> bloodthirsty crowd. He turns back to<br> his arena opponent just in time to<br> see the Besalisk take a swing. He<br> ducks, punching the four-armed<br> fighter in the gut. Two wild<br> haymakers later, and he stands<br> alone as the<br> gladiatorial<br> champion. 

Taking a deep breath, a Republic<br> soldier looks out onto the war zone<br> waging across the frozen surface of<br> Ilum. He grips his blaster rifle tightly<br> then, with a nod to the dozen squad-<br>mates beside him, he charges onto<br> the battlefield. 

Fighters combine discipline with<br> martial skills to become the best<br> pure warriors in the galaxy. Fighters<br> can be stalwart defenders of those in<br> need, cruel marauders, or brave advent-<br>urers. They fight for glory, honor, to right<br> wrongs, to gain power, to acquire wealth, or<br> simple for the thrill of battle.

<div style='margin-top:122px'></div>

### All in a Day's Work
Many fighters see adventures, raids on enemy strongholds, and dangerous missions as their jobs. Some want to defend those who can't defend themselves while others seek to use their muscle to carve their own place of importance in the galaxy. Fighters can take the form of guards, champions, bounty hunters, enforcers, mercenaries, freedom fighters, or simply armed explorers.

### Code Red
Most fighters come to the profession after receiving at least some amount of formal training from a military organization. Some attend formal academies; others are self-taught and well tested. A fighter may have taken up his weapon to escape a mundane life while another may be following a proud family tradition. Whatever their origins, most fighters share an unshakeable loyalty. Fighters follow orders with little hesitation, as failure can often mean death.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:676px'></div>

### Creating a Fighter
While creating your fighter character, consider where<br> your loyalties lie. You could be part of a formal military,<br> one of countless troopers fighting for your enterprise.<br> Perhaps you are a gun-for-hire, traveling the galaxy in<br> search of your next gig. What weapons do you prefer<br> and specialize in? Who or what do you fight for? Do you<br> have aspirations of a life beyond the battlefield, or<br> have you been at war so long you know of nothing<br> else?

#### Quick Build
You can make a fighter quickly by following these<br> suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your<br> highest ability modifier, depending on whether you<br> want to focus on melee combat or on ranged weapons<br> (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should<br> be Constitution. Second, choose the soldier<br> background.

### Fighting Style
Beginning at 1st level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the Fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Second Wind
Also at 1st level, you have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.

Once you've used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Action Surge
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.

Once you've used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

### Combat Superiority
Also at 2nd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

#### Maneuvers
You learn two maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under "Maneuvers" below, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the fighter table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.

Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

#### Superiority Dice
You have two superiority dice, which are d4s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice column of the fighter table. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Saving Throws
Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

___

<div align="center">

**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

</div>

___

### Maneuvers
The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

#### Commander's Strike
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

#### Disarming Attack
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.

#### Distracting Strike
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.

#### Evasive Footwork
When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.

#### Feinting Attack
You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

#### Goading Attack
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.

#### Lunging Attack
When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

#### Maneuvering Attack
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. 

That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

#### Menacing Attack 
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

#### Parry
When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.

#### Precision Attack
When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.

#### Pushing Attack
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.

#### Rally
On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.

#### Riposte
When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

#### Sweeping Attack
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

#### Trip Attack
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.

## Guardian
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">A dark-skinned human quickly runs down a corridor, the</span> metal armor under his grey cloak clanking with each step. He rounds the corner into the prison while the lights and power are still out, urging the weakened prisoners to escape. Just then a handful of slavers arrive and ready their blasters. The man draws and ignites a white-bladed lightsaber, ready to die for the strangers behind him. 

A sith pureblood, clad head to toe in black and red armor, charges towards a line of soldiers. Shot after shot deflects off his armor until he reaches his prey, where he unleashes his fury in a series of devastating lightsaber sweeps. 

A zabrak general dramatically leaps to his soon-to-be overrun squad, landing with a flurry of lightsaber attacks. At the arrival of this powerful Jedi, the attackers fall back.

Guardians are the master of the art of lightsaber combat. They focus on utilizing the everpresent power of the Force to enable devastating attacks, often single-handedly turning the tide of battle.

<div style='margin-top:205px'></div>

### Protector or Destroyer
An unstoppable agent of the Force, the guardian channels the power flowing through him into his weapons. Their skills with a lightsaber are unrivalled. Subduing their enemies and bolstering their allies, the guardian uses the Force to control what happens around them.

<div style='margin-top:205px'></div>

### Natural Leaders
The guardian's command of the Force lends them a powerful presence. Whether through fear and intimidation or respect and admiration, the guardian is one of the greatest generals on the battlefield. They are a symbol of power to their followers.

### Creating a Guardian
While creating your guardian, consider your attraction to the Force and its most famous practitioners – the Jedi and the Sith. Are you a member of one of the two orders, or do you walk a different path? Are you a soldier tapping into a latent Force-sensitivity? Were you trained in the force from a young age, or did you discover it as an adult? How do you treat those weaker than you? What was your family like? Do you see the Force as light and dark, or an impartial river of gray?

#### Quick Build
You can make a guardian quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the Jedi or Sith background.

You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the guardian table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

#### Force Points
You have a number of force points equal to your guardian level x 2, as shown in the Force Points column of the guardian table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the guardian table.

You may only cast force powers at 5th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

#### Forcecasting Ability
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___

<div align="center">

**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your forcecasting ability modifier

___

**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br>your forcecasting ability modifier

</div>

___

### Channel the Force
Also at 1st level, you know how to channel the Force to create a unique effect. You start with your choice of one from two such effects: Cause Harm or Lend Aid. At 3rd level, your Guardian Focus grants you an additional effect. When you use your Channel the Force, you choose which effect to create.

Some Channel the Force effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your universal force save DC.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

#### Cause Harm
As an action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to sap the life from a hostile creature you can see within 30 feet. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes necrotic damage equal to your guardian level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), or half as much on a successful one.

#### Lend Aid
As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force and touch a creature within 5 feet of you. That creature regains hit points equal to your guardian level + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one). Alternatively, if the creature is poisoned or diseased, you neutralize the poison or disease. If more than one poison or disease afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison or disease that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.

### Force-Empowered Strikes
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend force points to deal additional damage to the target, which is the same type as the weapon's damage. The additional damage is 1d8 for each point spent in this way. You can't deal more additional damage than the amount shown in the Focused Strikes column of the guardian table. 

### Fighting Style
Also at 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the Fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Guardian Aura
When you reach 3rd level, you gain an aura of your choice, as described at the end of the class description. When you reach 10th level you can select a second aura.

### Guardian Focus
Also at 3rd level, you begin to focus your studies on a specific lightsaber form, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your focus grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. 

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Force Purity
By 6th level, the Force flowing through you makes you immune to poison and disease.

### Improved Force-Empowered Strikes
By 11th level, you are so in tune with the Force that all your melee weapon strikes carry the power of the Force with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage. If you also use your Force-Empowered Strikes with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Force-Empowered Strikes. The damage is the same type as the weapon's damage.

\columnbreak

### Cleansing Touch
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action and expend a use of your Channel the Force ability to end one force power on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

### Guardian Auras
The auras are presented in alphabetical order. If multiple guardians grant the same aura, affected creatures can only benefit from it once. You must be conscious to grant the benefits of your auras.

At 10th level, the range of these auras increases to 15 feet, and at 18th level, the range of these auras increases to 30 feet.

#### Aura of Conquest
Whenever a creature who is frightened of you starts its turn within 5 feet of you, its speed is reduced to 0 and that creature takes psychic damage equal to half your guardian level.

#### Aura of Conviction
You and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you can't be frightened.

#### Aura of Devotion
You and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you can't be charmed.

#### Aura of Hatred
You and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you gain a bonus to the first melee weapon damage rolls you make each round equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). 

#### Aura of Presence
Whenever you or a friendly creature within 5 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1). 

#### Aura of Protection
Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to take that damage instead of that creature taking it. This feature doesn't transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage, and this damage can't be reduced in any way.

#### Aura of Vigor
Whenever a friendly creature starts its turn within 5 feet of you, that creature gains temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).

#### Aura of Warding
You and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you have resistance to damage from force powers.

## Guardian Foci
Different guardians focus on different lightsaber styles, called Forms, as they hone their powers. Your focus grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 15th, and 20th level.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

## Form I: Shii-Cho
Form I, also known as Determination Form, uses wild, unpredictable attacks designed to distract and disarm their foes. Those guardians who focus on Shii-Cho Form make seemingly random, yet deliberate, attacks to knock their opponents off-balance.

### Form Basics
When you choose this form as your focus at 3rd level, you learn the basics of the chosen form. You gain the Form I: Shii-Cho Lightsaber Form, detailed in Chapter 6. If you already know this form, you can instead choose another Lightsaber Form. You can't take a Lightsaber Form option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### The Way of the Sarlaac
Also at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can enter a frenetic stance for one minute. While in this stance, the first time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on your turn, it has disadvantage on the next melee attack roll it makes against you before the start of your next turn. Additionally, if that creature is within 5 feet of you, it must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier). On a failed save, it is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately move into the space it just vacated without provoking opportunity attacks.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated<br> or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't<br> use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Channel the Force
Lastly at 3rd level, you gain the following<br> Channel the Force option.

#### Disarming Slash
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force (no action required)  to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. The creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. If you are within 5 feet of the target, and you have a free hand, you can catch the item. Otherwise, the object lands at its feet.

### Unpredictable Motion
Beginning at 7th level, while you are wielding a melee weapon, opportunity attacks against you are made at disadvantage.

### Sarlaac Sweep
Starting at 15th level, when a creature moves to within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature. If the attack hits, you can attempt to damage another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

### Master of Determination
At 20th level, the erratic fluidity of your movement confounds even the most determined of foes. Your Strength or Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for these scores increases by 2. Additionally, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
- You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage from unenhanced weapons.
- Attack rolls made against you can't have advantage.
- When more than one creature is within 5 feet of you, you gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to the number of creatures within 5 feet of you, up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).
- When you use your Sarlaac Sweep feature, you have advantage on the attack roll, and you can apply the bonus damage to every creature within 5 feet of you.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

\pagebreakNum

## Form II: Makashi 
Form II, also known as Contention Form, encourages precision and efficiency over power, using jabs, parries and light cuts over slashes, blocks and chops. Those guardians who focus on Makashi Form utilize calculated blade manipulation, intense focus, and expert timing to confuse and trap their opponents.

### Form Basics
When you choose this form as your focus at 3rd level, you learn the basics of the chosen form. You gain the Form II: Makashi Lightsaber Form, detailed in Chapter 6. If you already know this form, you can instead choose another Lightsaber Form. You can't take a Lightsaber Form option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### The Way of the Ysalamiri 
Also at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can enter an offensive stance for one minute. While in this stance, you add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) to the first melee weapon attack and damage rolls you make each turn.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Channel the Force
Lastly at 3rd level, you gain the following Channel the Force option.

#### Makashi Riposte
When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force and use your reaction to attempt to deflect the attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your guardian level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can immediately make a single melee weapon attack against that creature as a part of the reaction.

### Shatterpoint
Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1<br> minute observing or interacting with<br> another creature outside combat,<br> you can use your connection to the<br> Force to sense their strengths<br> and weaknesses, and learn<br> certain information<br> about its capabilities<br> compared to your<br> own. The GM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

- Strength score
- Dexterity score
- Wisdom score
- Charisma score
- Armor Class
- Current hit points
- Total class levels (if any)
- Total Forcecaster levels (if any)

### Glancing Blow
Starting at 15th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

### Master of Contention
At 20th level, you are a duelist of the highest caliber.  Your Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
- You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage, and you ignore resistance to kinetic and energy damage.
- All melee attacks have disadvantage against you.
- Your melee weapon attacks inflict an additional damage die.

This effect ends early if<br> you are incapacitated or die.<br> Once you've used this<br> feature, you can't use it<br> again until you<br> finish a long rest.

## Form III: Soresu
Form III, also known as Resilience Form, relies on tight bladework and subtle dodges to provide maximum defensive coverage, minimizing exposure to ranged weaponry. Those guardians who focus on Soresu Form use broad footwork to move around the playing field, making broad, short sweeping motions that protect the body.

### Bonus Proficiencies
You gain proficiency in heavy armor.

### Form Basics
When you choose this form as your focus at 3rd level, you learn the basics of the chosen form. You gain the Form III: Soresu Lightsaber Form, detailed in Chapter 6. If you already know this form, you can instead choose another Lightsaber Form. You can't take a Lightsaber Form option more than once, even if you later get<br> to choose again.

### The Way of the Mynock
Also at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can enter a defensive stance for one minute. As a part of this bonus action, and as a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cast the *saber ward* power. When you do so, you have a number of special reactions equal to your proficiency bonus that you can only use to cast the *saber reflect* force power. You can only take<br> one reaction per turn.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated<br> or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use<br> it again until you finish a long rest.

### Channel the Force
Lastly at 3rd level, you gain the following Channel the Force option.

#### Advancing Defender
When you cast the *saber reflect* power, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to move up to 10 feet as a part of that same reaction. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

### Circle of Shelter
At 7th level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to ward the creature if you're wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll 1d8 and add the number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack's damage. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Stand Against the Tide
Beginning at 15th level, when a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Master of Resilience
At 20th level, your presence on the field of battle is an inspiration to your allies. Your Constitution and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
- You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage from unenhanced weapons.
- When you use the *saber reflect* force power, you can make a single melee attack on an enemy within 5ft of you as a part of that same reaction.

## Monk
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Her vibrostaff a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of</span> blaster bolts, a human springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of pirates on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.

Taking a deep breath, a zabrak covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging mercenaries reach him, he exhales and a blast of negative energy courses from his hands, engulfing his foes.

Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad mirialan steps into a shadow beneath an arch and nimbly climbs to the balcony a stone's throw above her. She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the warlord, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.

Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.

<div style='margin-top:47px'></div>

### The Power of Focus
Monks make careful study of a mystical energy that most monastic orders call focus. This energy is an element of the power that suffuses the galaxy—specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this energy within themselves to create powerful effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of focus in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of focus gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.

<div style='margin-top:47px'></div>

### Training and Asceticism
Most monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other power.

The majority of monks don't shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or brigands.

For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don't undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:565px'></div>

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/gFdtzpD.png' style='position:absolute;top:69px;right:-70px;width:570px;'/>

### Creating a Monk
As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery's threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?

Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community's rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?

As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness focus, monks are typically lawful in alignment.

#### Quick Build
You can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the agent background.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Martial Arts
Beginning at 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are chakrams, techblades, and any simple vibroweapons that don't have the two-handed property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:
- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the monk table.
- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a vibrostaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.

> ##### Variant: Monks with Lightweapons
> If monks gain lightweapon proficiency, consider letting them use lightweapons as monk weapons, provided the lightweapon has a vibroweapon analogue. For instance, chakrams count as monk weapons. If a monk gains proficiency in a light ring, they could also use it as a monk weapon.

### Unarmored Defense
Also at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice).

### Focus
Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of focus. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of focus points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel various focus features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more focus features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a focus point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended focus back into yourself. You  must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your focus points.

Some of your focus features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

___

<div align="center">

**Focus save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice)

</div>

___

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

#### Flurry of Blows
Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 focus point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

#### Patient Defense
You can spend 1 focus point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.

#### Step of the Wind
You can spend 1 focus point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

### Unarmored Movement
Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Unarmored Movement column of the monk table.

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

### Fighting Style
Starting at 3rd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the Fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Deflect Missiles
Also at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect a projectile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, and the damage is energy or ion, you can redirect it at another target if you have a weapon capable of doing so. You can spend 1 focus point to make a ranged attack as you deflect the projectile, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the projectile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.

### Monastic Order
Lastly at 3rd level, you commit yourself to one monastic order, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your order grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).

### Slow Fall
Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Stunning Strike
Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 focus point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

### Enhanced Strikes
Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.

### Evasion
At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects. When you are subjected to an effect, such as a consular's *force storm* or an engineer's *explosion*, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Stillness of Mind
Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

### Purity of Body
At 10th level, your mastery of the focus flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.

### Tongue of the Sun and Moon
Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the focus of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.

### Diamond Soul
Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of focus<br> grants you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a<br> saving throw and fail, you can spend<br> 1 focus point to reroll it and take<br> the second result.

### Timeless Body
At 15th level, your focus sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged abnormally. You can still die of old age, however. Additionally, you no longer need food or water.

\columnbreak

### Empty Body
Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 focus points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.

### Perfect Self
At 20th level, you've gained perfect control over your body. Your Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, when you roll for initiative and have no focus points remaining, you regain 2 focus points.

## Monastic Orders
Traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the locales scattered across the galaxy. Each order is based in a specific culture and is mutually exclusive, despite relying on the same basic techniques. Your order grants you features at 3rd, 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

## Echani Order
Monks of the Echani Order train relentlessly both with and without their weapons, to the point where the weapon becomes an extension of the body. Founded on a mastery of sword fighting, the tradition has expanded to include many different weapons.

### Path of the Echani
Beginning when you choose this order at 3rd level, your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of certain weapons. You gain the following benefits.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

#### Echani Weapons
Choose two types of weapons to be your Echani weapons: one vibroweapon and one blaster. Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon that lacks the special property. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don't already have it. Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you. Many of this tradition's features work only with your Echani weapons. When you reach 6th, 11th, and 17th level in this class, you can choose another type of weapon to be an Echani weapon for you, following the criteria above.

#### Agile Parry
If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding an Echani weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee weapon. You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren't incapacitated.

#### Echani's Shot
You can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with an Echani weapon more deadly. When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using an Echani weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon's type. You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.

### One with the Blade
At 6th level, you extend your focus into your Echani weapons, granting you the following benefits.

#### Enhanced Echani Weapons
Your attacks with your Echani weapons count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.

#### Deft Strike
When you hit a target with an Echani weapon, you can spend 1 focus point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

### Sharpen the Blade
Starting at 11th level, you gain the ability to augment your weapons further with your focus. As a bonus action, you can expend up to 3 focus points to grant one Echani weapon you touch a bonus to attack and damage rolls when you attack with it. The bonus equals the number of points you spent. This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again. This feature has no effect on an enhanced weapon that already has a bonus to attack and damage rolls.

### Unerring Accuracy
At 17th level, your mastery of weapons grants you extraordinary accuracy. If you miss with an attack roll using a monk weapon on your turn, you can reroll it. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns. 

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/WActKA4.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:6px;left:-280px;width:920px;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(-1)' />

## Nightsister Order
Monks of the Nightsister Order utilize an innate Force-sensitivity to commune with death. They learn to channel this power to drain the life of their foes to prolong their own existence. Males who join this order are called Nightbrothers.

### Ichor Lightning
Beginning when you choose this order at 3rd level, you gain a new attack option that you can use with the Attack action. This special attack is a ranged force attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is necrotic, and its damage die is a d4. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the monk table.

When you take the Attack action on your turn and use this special attack as part of it, you can spend 1 focus point to make the special attack twice as a bonus action.

When you gain the Extra Attack feature, this special attack can be used for any of the attacks you make as part of the Attack action.

When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier + your monk level (your choice, minimum of one).

### Dark Magick
At 6th level, you can use your action to force<br> each creature within 30 feet of you that can<br> see you to make<br> a Wisdom<br> saving throw<br> against your focus<br> save DC or be charmed<br> or frightened (your choice)<br> of you until the end of your<br> next turn. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Mastery of Death
Starting at 11th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend 1 focus point (no action required) to have 1 hit point instead.

### Spirit Blade Assault
At 17th level, as an action, you conjure a blade of negative energy and strike one creature within 5 feet of you with it, expending 1 to 10 focus points. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d10 necrotic damage per focus point spent, or half as much on a successful one.

## Teräs Käsi Order
Monks of the Teräs Käsi Order are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate focus to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.

### Open Hand Technique
Beginning when you choose this order at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy's focus when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:
- It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
- It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.
- It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.

### Wholeness of Body
At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself.<br> As an action, you can regain hit points equal to<br> three times your monk level. 

Once you've used this feature, you must<br> complete a long rest before you can use it again.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Tranquility
Starting at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a *sanctuary* force power that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the power can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the power equals your focus save DC.

### Quivering Palm
At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 focus points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same planet. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.

You can have only one creature under the effect of<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;this feature at a time. You can choose to<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;end the vibrations harmlessly<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(no action required).

## Operative
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">A Bothan spy takes a moment to adjust her infrared goggles.</span> Nimbly sidestepping the laser grid in the room, she slips to the computer at the far end. Counting down the seconds in her head, she slices the mainframe. Twenty seconds. Ten seconds. A handful of soldiers bursts into the room, but she is already gone – with the data in hand. 

With a wary eye on the door, a scruffy-looking Duros plays pazaak in a seedy cantina. When two city guards appear at the exit, he smiles and reaches under the table. Before they can move in, the smuggler flips the table and opens fire. The crowd scatters in panic, giving him just enough cover to escape. 

A gorgeous young human dances before an intoxicated senator in his parlor. She winks enticingly through her golden blonde hair as she sways closer. Leaning in for a kiss, the senator is instead surprised by the barrel of a hold-out blaster pistol shoved into his mouth. He has no time to shout before the assassin pulls the trigger. 

Operatives, whether good, bad, or neutral, are those who focus on a specific practice and utilize it to get the upper hand. They can come from any world or region in the galaxy, with origins from the lowliest scoundrel to the once social elite.

<div style='margin-top:137px'></div>

### Evading Danger
Operatives have a knack for getting out of trouble. They have an instinct for self-preservation that keeps them alive, but it's usually tempered with a need to experience the thrills that their profession has to offer, and many adventurous operatives are also saddled with a sense of honor that sometimes makes them go against their natural inclinations. No matter what their immediate concerns may be, survival is the name of the game.

<div style='margin-top:137px'></div>

### Outside the Law
Operatives don't often start out seeking to defy authority and break the law. Some are thrust into the profession as a means of rebellion. Others wind up on the wrong side of the law due to bad luck, poor decisions, or circumstances beyond their control. The skills they pick up along the way make them great members of any mission team.

### Creating an Operative
While creating your operative character, consider how you first started on your path. Maybe you were raised on the street and fell into the criminal element as a means of survival. You could be a simple trader who decided to strike against the Sith Empire when it encroached on your business. What would you say is your greatest skill set? What is your core, the truest essence about yourself that keeps you focused? Why would society treat you as a criminal, yet your allies hold you as a loyal companion?

#### Quick Build
You can make an operative quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence or Charisma. Second, choose the gambler background.

\pagebreakNum

### Expertise
Beginning at 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of skill proficiencies and one of your tool proficiencies, or two of your tool proficiencies. You gain expertise in those skills or tools.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or tools) to gain this benefit.

### Sneak Attack
Also at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. 

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the operative table.

### Bad Feeling
Starting at 2nd level, you have a wary eye, bordering on paranoia. When you roll for initiative, you can move up to your speed. This movement happens before the initiative order is determined. 

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Cunning Action
Also at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

### Operative Practice
At 3rd level, you choose a practice that you emulate in the exercise of your operative abilities, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your practice choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).

\columnbreak

### Uncanny Dodge
Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

### Evasion
Beginning at 7th level, when you are subjected to an effect, such as a consular's *force storm* or an engineer's *explosion*, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Reliable Talent
By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Blindsense
Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

### Slippery Mind
By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. 

### Elusive
Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.

### Stroke of Luck
At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. Your Dexterity and Intelligence scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, if your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Operative Practices
Operatives have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different operatives steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the different operative practices. Your practice grants you features at 3rd, 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

## Gunslinger Practice
Those operatives who choose the Gunslinger Practice are the masters of the trick shot. The Gunslinger and his blaster are the perfect team, utilizing knowledge of their enemies vulnerabilities to take advantage of every opportunity.

### Dive For Cover
When you choose this practice at 3rd level, you learn to quickly move into cover when under fire. Once per round, when you are the target of a ranged attack, or you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw, and there is cover within 10 feet of you, you can move up to 10 feet (no action required). You must end this movement in cover.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Trick Shooter
Also at 3rd level, you learn a number of trick shots you can use to debilitate enemies and impress allies. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a trick shot. 

Some of your trick shots<br> require your target to make<br> a saving throw to resist the trick<br> shot's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

___

<div align="center">

**Trick Shot save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Dexterity modifier

</div>

___

#### Blinding Shot
You attempt to blind the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn. 

#### Brutal Shot
You attempt to knock the target prone. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.  

#### Hampering Shot
You attempt to hobble the enemy's movement. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, its movement speed is reduced by half and it makes Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage until the end of its next turn.

### Spinning Flourish
Beginning at 9th level you can flourish your weapon in an intimidating or charming manner. As an action, you can cause one creature within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). On a failed save, the target is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Ricochet Shot
Starting at 13th level you learn how to work all the angles. Once per turn, when you take the Attack action and miss with a ranged weapon attack, you can repeat the attack against a different target within 10 feet of the original target (no action required).

### Quickdraw
At 17th level, you learn to perform miracles with just a blaster and some nerve. On your first turn in combat, if you aren't surprised, you can use your action to attack creatures that have not yet acted. Choose up to six such creatures that you can see, making a ranged weapon attack against each. On a hit, you deal normal weapon damage and can apply a single trick shot to each attack made this way. 

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Lethality Practice
Those operatives who choose the Lethality Practice use disguises to get close to their enemies, then leverage the toxic power of poisons to debilitate them and capitalize on their weaknesses. 

### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this practice at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner's kit.

### Assassinate
Also at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. Additionally, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

### Lethal Strikes
Lastly at 3rd level, you learn how to read your foes and strikes their weak points. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a lethal strike. 

Some of your lethal strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the lethal strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

___

<div align="center">

**Lethal Strike save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Dexterity modifier

</div>

___

#### Priming Attack
You attempt to prime the target. The target must make a Dexterity, Constitution, or Wisdom saving throw (your choice). On a failed save, the next time you deal Sneak Attack damage against the target before the end of your next turn, you roll four additional Sneak Attack dice.

#### Target Assessment
You attempt to infer crucial details about your foe. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the GM tells you two of the following characteristics of your choice:
- Highest ability score
- Lowest ability score
- Strongest saving throw
- Weakest saving throw

#### Vulnerable Strike
You attempt to stagger the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the next time you would make an attack roll against the target before the end of your next turn, you can instead force the target to make a saving throw with the ability score of your choice. On a failed save, the creature takes normal weapon damage and you can apply your Sneak Attack dice to the roll.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Poisoner
Beginning at 9th level, you are a master of poisons. You can apply a poison as a bonus action, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal the application of poisons. 

Additionally, you can improve the capability of one dose of poison. To use this benefit, you must have a poisoner's kit, and the poison must be within reach. If the poison is applied before the end of your next short or long rest, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw made to resist your poison. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

### Impostor
Starting at 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least 1 minute studying these three components of the person's behavior: listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms. If you can only study some of these aspects (such as only having writing samples, or only audio recordings), you can mimic that aspect of the person, but not other aspects you have not studied.

Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.

### Death Strike
At 17th level, you become a<br> master of instant<br> death. When you<br> deal weapon<br> damage to a<br> creature that is<br> surprised, it must<br> make a Constitution<br> saving throw against<br> your lethal strike<br> save DC. On a <br>failed save, double<br> the damage of<br> your attack against<br> the creature.

## Sharpshooter Practice
Those operatives who choose the Sharpshooter Practice are bringers of death. Striking from a safe distance, the Sharpshooter uses precision shooting to control the battlefield and bring targets down quickly.

### Assume the Position
Beginning at 3rd level, you don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if your target is greater than 30 feet from you and no enemies are within 5 feet of you. In addition, standing up from prone now only costs 5 feet of movement.

Additionally, you gain proficiency with two martial blasters of your choice.

### Place Shot
Also at 3rd level, you perfect the art of placing distant shots for maximum effectiveness in debilitating and controlling your enemies. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a placed shot. 

Some of your placed shots require your target to make a saving throw to resist the placed shot's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

___

<div align="center">

**Placed Shot save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Dexterity modifier

</div>

___

#### Disarming Shot
You attempt to disarm a creature with your attack. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. The object lands at its feet.

#### Penetrating Shot
You attempt to damage another target with the same attack. Choose a second target within 15 feet of and directly behind your initial target. If the original attack roll would hit the second target, it takes two dice worth of Sneak Attack damage.

The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

#### Suppressive Shot
You attempt to pin the target to its location. The<br> target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw<br> or be frightened of you until the end of its<br> next turn.

### Head Shot
At 9th level, you are at your<br> deadliest when your enemies<br> are unaware of the danger<br> they are in. You have advantage on attack rolls<br> against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in<br> combat yet. 

Additionally, any hit you score against a<br> creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Distracting Shot
Starting at 13th level, you are able to defend your compatriots from afar. When a friendly creature you can see within your weapon's normal range is the target of a ranged attack, or forced to make a saving throw, and the source of the effect is within your weapon's normal range, you can use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against the source. On a hit, instead of dealing damage, the target of your attack has disadvantage on the attack roll against your ally, or your ally has advantage on the saving throw to resist the effect.

### Double Tap
At 17th level, you've learned to capitalize when you have the advantage. When you take the Attack action and make an attack with advantage, you can choose to forgo the advantage. If you do, you can make an additional attack against the target or another creature within 5 feet of it (no<br> action required).<br> Both attacks can<br> benefit from your <br>Sneak Attack<br> damage, instead of<br> only one.

## Scholar
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">An overwhelming horde of tusken raiders bears down on a</span> chiss and her fellow adventurers. She gives the order and her allies unleash a single coordinated attack cutting deep into their lines. Under her command the enemy is quickly routed against all odds, all according to plan.

Deep within the once thought abandoned ruins, a nautolan tends to his companions wounds as they rest. Countless long nights of study and training have conditioned him to keep going even when all others have exhausted themselves. He will see them through this.

A twi'lek in fine vestments addresses a gathering crowd. What was the making of an angry mob begins to disperse, his mere presence putting them at ease, giving his companions time to make their escape. 

Scholars are master of the mundane arts, using methodical practices to turn the tables to their advantage. From years of study and testing, scholars take in the situation around them and quickly formulate the means to achieve whatever they have minds set to. Whatever pursuit they follow, a scholar will have a plan for anything that comes their way.

<div style='margin-top:167px'></div>

### The Pursuit of Knowledge
A true scholar is never satisfied. They are always<br> seeking out a new answer to a new question. This<br> often goes hand-in-hand with seeking a life of<br> adventure, to explore new, hidden areas, or<br> accompany those that do. The life of a scholar often<br> times begins in the mundane, as a teacher or sage.<br> Sometimes they serve as doctors, diplomats, or as<br> officers in the military.

<div style='margin-top:167px'></div>

### To Learn, To Know
For scholars, mundane life is often too slow. When life<br> becomes stagnant or when an answer cannot be<br> found, the call to adventure rings louder. Scholars will<br> often go to ancient, forgotten, and often dangerous<br> places to find something to quench their thirst for<br> knowledge.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/cPxvPXQ.png' style='position:absolute;top:37px;right:65px;width:330px;z-index:1000' />

### Creating a Scholar
As you create a scholar, it's important to think of where<br> you gained your knowledge. Did you serve as an<br> apprentice under a master? Did you attend college or<br> other formal education? Perhaps you gained it on your<br> own, searching out and pouring over dusty tomes<br> found in forgotten places. Where did your thirst for<br> knowledge come from? Insatiable curiosity? Always<br> wanting to know the right answer? Or do you have<br> something to prove? Think about what field you wish to<br> pursue and think of what is driving you in that<br> direction.

#### Quick Build
You can make a scholar quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score. Your next-highest score should be Dexterity. Second, choose the noble background.

### Academic Superiority
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to apply your studies in practical ways known as maneuvers. Your maneuvers are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

#### Maneuvers
You know two maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under "Maneuvers" below, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the scholar table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.

Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

#### Superiority Dice
You have two superiority dice, which are d4s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice column of the scholar table. This die changes as you gain scholar levels, as shown in the Academic Superiority column of the scholar table. A superiority die is expended when you use it. 

You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Saving Throws
Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:  

___

<div align="center">

**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Intelligence modifier

</div>

___

### Maneuvers
The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Administer Aid
As an action, you can expend a superiority die to tend to a creature you can touch. The creature regains a number of hit points equal to the number rolled + your Intelligence modifier.

#### Assess the Situation
You can expend one superiority die to make a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check as a bonus action, adding the superiority die to the check.

#### Crippling Strike
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to cripple the creature. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll and the creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of their next turn.

#### Deliberate Movement
You can expend one superiority die to take the Disengage action as a bonus action and ignore the effects of standard difficult terrain until the end of your turn.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

#### Exploit Weakness
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and deal additional damage equal to the number rolled. This damage cannot be reduced in any way.

#### Goading Attack
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.

#### Heads Up
When a friendly creature who can see or hear you makes a saving throw, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die, adding the number rolled to the result of the saving throw. You can use this maneuver before or after making the saving throw, but before any effects of the saving throw are determined.

#### Measured Action
As a reaction when you make a roll for a contested skill check, you can expend a superiority die to add to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the contested skill check roll, but before any effects of the contested skill check are determined.

#### One Step Ahead
When you roll initiative and you are not surprised, you can expend a superiority die and add the number rolled to your initiative.

#### Targeted Strike
When an ally makes an attack against a creature, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die. You add the superiority die to the attack roll, and the damage roll if it hits. You can use this maneuver before or after the attack roll, but before the GM determines whether or not the attack hits.

### Critical Analysis
Also at 1st level, you are able to analyze a target, develop a plan on how to best overcome any potential obstacle, and execute that plan with ruthless efficiency. As a bonus action on your turn, you can analyze a target you can see within 60 feet of you. For the next minute, or until you analyze another target, you gain the following benefits:
- When you analyze a hostile creature, your attack and damage rolls made with weapons with the finesse property or blaster weapons against that target may use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity.
- When you analyze a friendly creature, the target can end your Critical Analysis on them (no action required) to add your Intelligence modifier to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once a friendly creature has benefited from this ability, they can not do so again until they complete a short or long rest.

\pagebreakNum

### Discovery
As you adventure, your studies have helped you discover new practices you can apply to your skills.

At 2nd level, you master two discoveries of your choice. Your discovery options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain scholar levels, you gain additional discoveries of your choice, as shown in the Discoveries column of the scholar table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discovery that you could learn at that level.

### Sage Advice
When you reach 2nd level, you can spend 1 minute spreading your knowledge and experience, advising those around you. When you do so, choose a skill or tool you are proficient with and a number of friendly creatures up to your Intelligence modifier within 30 feet of you who can hear you and who can understand you. Once within the next hour, the next time each creature would make an ability check with the chosen skill or tool, they may add their proficiency bonus to the roll if they are not already proficient. A creature may only benefit from this feature once. If a creature is targeted by this feature again before using it, they can choose to retain the first benefit or replace it with the new skill or tool instead.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Starting at 13th level, you regain the ability to use it after you complete a short or long rest.

### Expertise
At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of skill proficiencies and one of your tool proficiencies, or two of your tool proficiencies. You gain expertise in those skills or tools.

At 10th level, you can choose another two proficiencies (in skills or tools) to gain this benefit.

### Academic Pursuit
Also at 3rd level, you dedicate your studies towards a pursuit, which is detailed at the end of the class description. The pursuit you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 9th, and 17th level.

As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).

### Multitasker
Starting at 5th level, you can take a second reaction each round. You can only take one reaction per turn.

\columnbreak

### Calm and Collected
Beginning at 14th level, when you make a saving throw from an effect you can see, you may gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Intelligence modifier. 

Once you have used this feature, you must wait until a short or long rest before using it again.

### Adaptable Intellectual
At 18th level, you are able to effectively prepare for any mission on hand. At the end of a long rest, you may choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discover that you could learn at that level.

### Knowledge Unbound
When you reach 20th level, you are the pinnacle of your pursuit. Your Intelligence score increases by 4. Your maximum for that score increases by 4. Additionally, you can use any maneuver you know without expending a superiority die,<br> rolling a d4 instead.

## Academic Pursuits
Your pursuit is a representation<br> of which fields you have studied<br> or how you practically apply<br> your knowledge. Your pursuit<br> grants you<br> features at 3rd,<br> 6th, 9th, and<br> 17th level.

### Additional Maneuvers
Lastly at 3rd level, you gain access to new maneuvers which reflect the progress of your studies into the medical arts. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.

#### Adrenaline Hit
You can use an action and expend one superiority die to inject a creature with regenerative medication that temporarily enhances their agility. When you do so, a creature you can touch regains hit points equal to the superiority die roll. Additionally, until the start of your next turn, when that creature would take damage, the amount is reduced by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier.

#### Emergency Prescription
As an action, you can expend one superiority die and touch a creature. That creature regains hit points equal to result of the die + your Intelligence modifier, and when that creature makes their first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw before the start of your next turn they roll the superiority die and add it to the roll.

#### Enhancement Injection
As an action, you can expend one superiority die to inject a creature you can touch with enhancements, granting them temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Intelligence modifier, which last for 1 minute. Additionally, when the target makes a Strength or Constitution check or saving throw while it has these temporary hit points, it gains a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier.

#### Neuroblock

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Reassure
As an action, you can expend a superiority die and call out to a creature within 60 feet that can see or hear you that is charmed, frightened, or stunned. When you do so, that creature immediately makes another saving throw, adding the amount rolled to the save.

#### Remove Toxins
As an action, you can expend a superiority die to purge the toxins from a creature you can touch. The target regains hit points equal to the number rolled and, if it is poisoned or diseased, you neutralize the poison or disease. If more than one poison or disease afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison or disease that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.

#### Smelling Salts
As a bonus action, you can expend a superiority die to heal a creature you can touch by a number of hit points equal to the number rolled.

\columnbreak

#### Transfusion
Once per turn when you hit a creature with a finesse melee weapon, you can expend a superiority to give you or an ally that is within 5 feet of the creature a transfusion. Add the superiority dice to the damage you deal. You or your ally gain hit points equivalent to the damage you deal to the creature. 

You can be the creature hit with the attack as long as there is an ally with 5 feet of you, in which you can let it hit without rolling an attack and must choose an ally to heal with the transfusion.

#### Weak Point Strike
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die to temporarily daze the creature. Add the number rolled to the damage of the weapon attack and the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

### Field Surgeon
Beginning at 6th level, whenever you expend superiority dice to restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to a creature, you can roll an additional die d6 and add it to the roll. This die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: 1d8 at 7th level, 1d10 at 11th level, and to 1d12 at 15th level.

Additionally, whenever you expend superiority dice to restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to a creature, if the creature is the target of your Critical Analysis, you can instead choose the maximum on both dice. Once you've used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 11th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

### Resuscitate
Starting at 9th level, through your medical studies you have learned to delay seemingly inevitable death. As a bonus action, you can stabilize a creature you can touch that has 0 hit points. 

Additionally, as an action, you can tend to a creature you can touch that has died since the end of your last turn. The creature immediately regains 1 hit point and stabilizes. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Panacea
Once you've reached 17th level, you've developed the formula to concoct a cure-all miracle solution: a panacea. Over the course of 10 minutes, you can expend rare medical supplies worth 1,000 cr to create your panacea in a simple syringe. The panacea retains its potency for 24 hours. As a bonus action, a creature can use the panacea. Alternatively, as an action, they can administer it to another creature within 5 feet.

The target has its exhaustion level reduced by one and regains all of its hit points. If the target is diseased, poisoned, paralyzed, or stunned, the condition ends.

Once you create a panacea, you can't create another until you finish a long rest.

##### Side Effects

| d20 | Side Effects  |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1  | The creature turns out to be allergic to this specific treatment. Every ability score is reduced by 1. |
| 2  | The creature starts sneezing uncontrollably. Any attack rolls with a die roll value of 19 results in a miss due to a poorly timed sneeze. |
| 3 | The creature's legs become swollen. Their move speed becomes at most half their normal movement speed. |
| 4 | The creature becomes one size larger or smaller. |
| 5 | The skin at their joints turns into a wooden material, giving them a bonus of +2 to AC. |
| 6 | The creature's body starts producing powerful stomach acid in high amounts. The creature can use an action to spew stomach acid in a 15 feet cone. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 acid damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. | 
| 7 | The creature becomes mute and has uncontrollable gas. They have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on smell.|

| 9 | The creature gains +4 to perception checks based on hearing, but everything seems uncomfortably loud to them. They gain vulnerability to sonic damage. |
| 10 | The treatment slows down their brain function, reducing their Intelligence by 4.|
| 11  | The creature's skin turns dark purple. If they are already purple, they turn bright pink instead.  |
| 12  |  The creature becomes covered in sickly, green pustules. When the creature is hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes 1d4 poison damage. |
| 13 | The creature's skin starts to seriously bloat up from internal pressure build-up, and a strong impact may cause it to explode. Whenever the creature takes damage, the creature has to pass a concentration check or the creature takes kinetic damage equal to half their maximum hit points. Other creatures within 10 feet of the explosion also take a fourth of the damage. Once this explosion occurs, their skin becomes very soft. |
| 14 | The creature rapidly grows body hair all over, including the face, until they resemble a wookiee. If they are already a wookiee, the reverse effect occurs; all hair immediately falls off, leaving the skin bare. |
| 15 | The creature's body temperature fluctuates to extremes. They gain resistance to cold and fire damage.|
| 16 | The creature becomes ravenous. Every hour they haven't eaten a meal they gain a level of exhaustion. |
| 17 | The creature believes they are the chosen one. |
| 18 | The creature has a difficult time resting. The amount they heal from Hit Dice is now halved. |
| 19 | The creature's movement speed is increased by 15 feet, and opportunity attacks on them have disadvantage. |

The target automatically succeeds if it is immuned to charm, it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.

### Force of Personality
Beginning at 6th level, as an action, you suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) to influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the effect.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you, and it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for up to 24 hours. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the effect ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that an officer givers her gun to the first smuggler she meets. If the condition isn't met before the effect ends, the activity isn't performed.

If you or any of your companions damage the target, the effect ends.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Scout
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Rough and grizzled looking, a human stalks alone through</span> the shadows of trees, hunting the quarry he knows is planning a raid on a nearby settlement. Clutching a techblade in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.

After tumbling away from the shrapnel of a missile's<br> explosion, a bothan finds her feet and quick-fires two<br> shots from her carbine at the oncoming tank.<br> Shrugging off the wave of fear that threatens to<br> permeate her entire being, she strafes around her foe,<br> firing shot after shot to try to penetrate the tank's thick<br> armor.

Glancing at his wristpad, a sullustan looks through the eyes of his tracker droid. Transmitting instructions, he sends his droid to distract the houk he's been tracking while he readies his sniper rifle for the shot.

Scouts are the first on the trail and the last to lose it, tracking their quarry for miles unimpeded. They are adaptable, wielding both tech powers and their weaponry to overcome their foes.

<div style='margin-top:40px'></div>

### Deadly Hunters
Warriors in their own right, scouts specialize in tracking and hunting the monsters that threaten civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible Force-wielders, and renegade droids. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through any terrain and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Scouts focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.

Scouts acquire the ability to cast tech powers<br> through utilization of a wristpad. Their powers, like<br> their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and<br> the hunt. A scout's talents and abilities are honed with<br> deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the<br> civilization.

<div style='margin-top:40px'></div>

### Independent Adventurers
Though a scout might make a living as a bounty hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a scout's true calling is to defend civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in. In some places, scouts gather in secretive orders, though many scouts are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a rancor or a band of pirates attacks, a scout might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense. This fierce independence makes scouts well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, scouts respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:525px'></div>

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/8Nj1Jxq.png' style='position:absolute;top:22px;right:10px;width:386px;z-index:1000' />

### Creating a Scout
As you create your scout character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, tracking together until you mastered the scout's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by some kind of bestial monstrosity on which you've sworn revenge? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of mercenaries. 

What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work, or a significant change?

What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?

#### Quick Build
You can make a scout quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability modifier, depending on whether you want to focus on melee combat or on ranged weapons (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Intelligence. Second, choose the bounty hunter background.

You lose this benefit if you move or fall prone, either voluntarily or because of some external effect. You are still automatically detected if any effect or action causes you to no longer be hidden. 

If you are still hidden on your next turn, you can<br> &emsp;&emsp;continue to remain motionless and gain this<br> &emsp;&emsp;benefit until you are detected.

&emsp;&emsp;Additionally, you can no longer be tracked by<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;unenhanced means, unless you choose to leave<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a trail.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

### Foe Slayer 
At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter. Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.

Additionally, once on each of your turns, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

Scouts tend to share knowledge amongst them selves, focusing on specific techniques and honing them to perfection. Those scouts who adopt the same<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;technique tend to share a camaraderie with<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each other. Your technique grants you<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

### Focused Superiority
When you choose this technique at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

#### Maneuvers
You know two maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under "Maneuvers" below, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the Deadeye Technique Focused Superiority table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.

Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

#### Superiority Dice
You have two superiority dice, which are d4s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice column of the Deadeye Technique Focused Superiority table. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Saving Throws
Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

___

<div align="center">

**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

</div>

___

### Maneuvers
The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Crippling Shot
When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die to cripple its movement. Add the number rolled to the damage of the ranged weapon attack. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have its movement speed halved. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw to end the effect.

#### Daring Escape
You can expend one superiority die to take the Disengage action as a bonus action until the end of your turn. Until the end of this turn, you have advantage on all Strength (Athletics) checks.

#### Covering Fire
When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. 

That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.

\pagebreakNum

#### Disarming Shot
When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. Add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.

#### Distracting Shot
When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.

#### Exploit Weakness
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and deal additional damage equal to the number rolled. This damage cannot be reduced in any way.

#### Penetrating Shot
When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose up to two creatures within 15 feet of and directly behind your initial target. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature(s), it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die.

The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

#### Precision Attack
When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.

#### Return Fire
When a creature misses you with a ranged attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a ranged weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

### Mark of the Deadeye
Also at 3rd level, the range of your Ranger's Quarry feature doubles. Additionally, when making ranged weapon attacks against the target of your Ranger's Quarry, the normal and long range of your ranged weapons double.

### Shoot First
Starting at 11th level, you have learned that the person who shoots first is often the one who walks out alive. When you make a ranged weapon attack against a creature that has not yet acted during your first turn in combat and you have advantage on the roll, you can reroll one of the dice once.

Additionally, on a hit, you deal an extra 1d6 damage of the same type as the weapon.

### Overwatch
At 15th level, you have become a master at protecting your allies from afar. When a creature attempts to make an opportunity attack against an allied creature, or forces your ally to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make an attack roll against the enemy creature.

## Stalker Technique
Some Scouts become consumed by the thrill of the hunt. Only heard and never seen they revel in the violence of battle. Followers of the Stalker Technique hone their abilities to track others utilizing a variety of techniques: camouflage, infiltration, surveillance, and target acquisition.

### Accomplished Ambusher
When you choose this technique at 3rd level, when you take the Attack action against a creature that is surprised, you can make one additional attack against that creature as a part of that action.

If you are less than 30 feet from your target, the Dexterity (Stealth) check is made with disadvantage.

### Concealment
Beginning at 7th level, you've become adept at<br> evading creatures that rely on darkvision.<br> While in darkness, you are invisible to any<br> creature that relies on darkvision to see you in<br> that darkness.

Additionally, when you hit a creature with a<br> ranged weapon attack while hidden, you can force<br> that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw<br> against your tech save DC.

## Sentinel
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Clad in black robes, the rattataki pulls his hood forward and</span> steps into the shadowy alcove, only to reappear further down the hall. As his quarry walks past, he presses the hilt of his lightsaber to the back of their head, quickly toggling it on-and-off. He is gone before the corpse hits the ground.

The togruta dashes across the battlefield, doublesaber deflecting blaster shots to the ground. She pulls her wounded padawan to her feet, and guides her away from the warzone.

Green-bladed lightsaber a blur, the cathar ferociously presses the attack. With each strike, she guides her opponent closer to the ravine's edge. A flurry of blows followed by a quick *force push* and her foe tumbles over the edge.

Sentinels are the masters of blending force powers with weapon attacks. They weave the two together so expertly that their foes have trouble predicting them.

<div style='margin-top:212px'></div>

### The Middle of the Road
The sentinel uses stealth and subterfuge to accomplish the will of the Force. Where the consular focuses on mastery of the Force and the guardian focuses on the mastery of the lightsaber, the sentinel focuses on merging the two. 

<div style='margin-top:212px'></div>

### Solitary Action
Sentinels are notoriously independent, most comfortable acting alone and without backup; where some use a team to make up for their weaknesses, the sentinel uses the Force to overcome theirs. While some take this independent streak to the extreme, they are usually accepting of authority, as long as they are allowed to carry out directions using their preferred methods.

### Creating a Sentinel
While creating your sentinel, consider your personal philosophy in regards to the Force and its most famous practitioners – the Jedi and the Sith.  Are you a member of one of the two orders, or do you walk a different path? Are you an operative tapping into a latent Force-sensitivity? Were you trained in the force from a young age, or did you discover it as an adult? How do you treat those weaker than you? What was your family like? Do you see the Force as light and dark, or an impartial river of gray?

#### Quick Build
You can make a sentinel quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom or Charisma. Second, choose the Jedi or Sith background.

### Forcecasting
Beginning at 1st level, in your meditations on the force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

#### Force Powers Known
You learn 6 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the sentinel table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

#### Force Points
You have a number of force points equal to your sentinel level x 3, as shown in the Force Points column of the sentinel table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the sentinel table.

You may only cast force powers at 5th, 6th, and 7th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

#### Forcecasting Ability
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___

<div align="center">

**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your forcecasting ability modifier

### Force-Empowered Self
Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystical energy of the Force throughout your body. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 force point to use a Force-Empowered Self effect. Each effect uses a d4, which changes as you gain sentinel levels, as shown in the Kinetic Combat column of the sentinel table. You

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

have three such effects: Deflection, Double Strike, and Slow Time. You can only use each effect once per turn, and you can only use one effect per hit.

#### Double Strike
You can roll a Kinetic Combat die and deal additional damage equal to the amount rolled.

### Enlightened Evasion
When you reach 15th level, when you are subjected to a damage-dealing effect that forces you to make a saving throw, you can spend 2 force points to add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to the saving throw if doesn't already include that modifier. If you do so, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. You can wait until after you roll the d20 to use this feature, but you must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

### Center of the Force
At 20th level, you are perfectly centered with the Force. Your Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.

Additionally, once per turn, when you would roll a Kinetic Combat die, you can instead choose the maximum.

### Sentinel Ideals
The ideals are presented in alphabetical order. You can't benefit from a Sentinel Ideal option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Ideal of the Agile
You gain a swimming speed and a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. When you make a long jump, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Wisdom or Charisma score (your choice).

#### Ideal of the Steadfast
When you would make a melee weapon attack roll, you can instead force the target to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier + any bonuses to melee weapon attack rolls).

On a failed save, the target takes normal weapon damage and is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit.

## Path of Focus
The ways of the Force can reveal themselves to a sentinel through intense concentration and, most importantly, focus. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Focus use debilitating bursts of lightsaber strikes and force powers to exhaust their foes, crushing any hopes they had of mounting an effective defense.

### Focused Burst
Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you learn the *burst* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action. If more than one creature would be affected, and you use your Double Strike feature, only one creature takes the additional damage. Finally, you add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of +1) to damage rolls with it, and creatures that succeed on their saving throw take half damage, instead of none.

### Blade Dance
Also at 3rd level, when you deal damage to a creature within 5 feet of you, you can move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Blade Storm
At 7th level, your bursts become even more overwhelming. Once on your turn, when a creature takes damage from you twice, you can immediately make one additional attack against that creature (no action required). This attack uses your Kinetic Combat die instead of the weapon's damage die.

### Focused Flow
By 13th level, whenever you use a Force-Empowered Self feature, you may instead expend no force points and roll a d4 in place of your Kinetic Combat die.

### &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Strike
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;At 18th level, your bursts can overpower even<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; the fiercest of foes. Once on your turn,<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when a creature takes damage from <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you three times, you can force it to<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make a Constitution saving throw<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; against your universal force<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; save DC. On a failed save,<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it becomes stunned<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until the end of its<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next turn.

## Path of Shadows
In darkness, there is protection. Those<br> sentinels who follow the Path of Shadows<br> utilize a calculated plan, becoming masters<br> of stealth and ambush who forgo the head-on<br> attack for the vulnerable flank.

### Dead Silence
Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you learn the *psychic charge* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and hit the target. Finally, when you hit a creature with the *psychic charge* force power and the target tries to speak, it takes additional damage equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1), and its voice does not produce sound until the end of your next turn.

### Cloak of Shadows
Also at 3rd level, you can take the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Additionally, you can try to hide when you are lightly obscured from the creature from which you are hiding.

### Shadow Strike
At 7th level, you learn to strike from the shadows. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the roll. 

The extra damage increases to 2d6 at 11th level and 3d6 at 17th level.

### Shadow Step
By 13th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. While you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on<br> the first melee attack you make before the end of<br> the turn.

### Shadow's Wrath
At 18th level, your training has taught you advanced techniques while you maneuver in the shadows.<br> While you are hidden from your target, the first<br> attack roll you make each round does not automatically reveal your presence. Make a<br> Dexterity (Stealth) check against your target's<br> Wisdom (Perception) check. On a success, you<br> remain hidden. If you are also invisible, you<br> remain invisible.
