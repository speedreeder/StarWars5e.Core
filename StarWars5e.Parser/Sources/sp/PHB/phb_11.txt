On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.

If the creature attempts to cast a power with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the power doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the power. If it can't, the power is wasted.

On a hit, the target takes 1d8 + your forcecasting ability modifier damage. The type is of the normal damage dealt by the weapon.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to harm itself automatically negates the effect of the power.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the power ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

- **Ruin**, for results which are certain to end in death or tragedy

The power doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the use of additional powers or the loss or gain of a companion.

If you use this power two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a neutral result regardless of the actual outcome.

___

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a 3rd or 4th level force slot, the damage increases by 1d6 (3d6). At 5th or 6th level, the damage increases by 2d6 (4d6). At 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 (5d6).

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a power slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Darkness
_2nd-level dark side power_

Darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere until the power ends. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and unenhanced light can't illuminate it.

If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the darkness comes from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object blocks the darkness.

If this power's area overlaps with light created by a 2nd-level power or lower, this power and the light are dispelled.

_1st-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Saber Ward
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you take cold, energy, fire, ion, lightning, or sonic damage
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 round

This power absorbs damage from incoming energy attacks, lessening its effect on you and distributing it throughout your body. You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, you gain 5 temporary hit points to potentially absorb the attack. These temporary hit points last until the start of your next turn.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, the temporary hit points increases by 5 for each slot level above 1st.

_4th-level dark side power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beast you can see must succeed on a Wisdom save or be charmed. If you or your companions are fighting it, it has advantage on this saving throw.

While it's charmed, you have a telepathic link to it if you're on the same planet. You can use this link to issue commands while you are conscious, no action required, which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action. If it completes the order and doesn't receive further orders, it focuses on defending itself.

You can use your action to take total control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the beast takes only the actions you decide and nothing you don't allow it to. You can also have the beast use a reaction, but this takes your reaction as well.

If the beast takes damage, it makes another Wisdom save. On a success, the power ends.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a 5th-level force slot, the duration is up to 10 minutes. At a 6th-level slot, the duration is up to 1 hour. At a slot of 7th or higher, the duration is up to 8 hours.

You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the power. If the saving throw succeeds, the power ends. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a 6th-level force slot, the duration is 10 minutes. When you use a 7th-level force slot, the duration is 1 hour. When you use a force slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours.

#### Earthquake
_8th-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Eruption
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 500 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.

The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken.

When you cast this power and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone. 

This power can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.

***Fissures.*** Fissures open throughout the power's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the power. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the power's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it opens.

A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).

***Structures.*** The tremor deals 50 kinetic damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the power and at the start of each of your turns until the power ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 kinetic damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become buried.

#### Enfeeble

___
- **Prerequisite:** Convulsion
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10 - foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save. 

If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 kinetic damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature's choice) against the power's save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 7th level or higher, you can create two additional pillars for each slot level above 6th.

You can appear to be shorter or taller by about a foot and change the appearance of your body and weight, but you cannot change the basic structure of your body. This effect can include your clothes, weapons, and other belongings on your person.

This effect is only visual, so any sort of physical contact will only interact with the real size and shape of you.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:16px'></div>

&emsp;Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your force save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

#### Force Push/Pull

You imbue your weapon with the purifying light of the Force. As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within your weapon's reach, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes wreathed in a glowing barrier of force energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves before then, it immediately takes 1d8 force damage, and the power ends.

This power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 force damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.

During that time, it rolls a d6 and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. The target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### Greater Heal
_6th-level light side power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Improved Heal
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose a creature that you can see within range. A surge of positive energy washes through the creature, causing it to regain 70 hit points. This power also ends blindness, deafness, and any diseases affecting the target. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 7th level or higher, the healing increases by 10 for each slot level above 6th.

#### Guidance
_At-will light side power_

#### Hallucination
_2nd-level dark side power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You craft a dangerous illusion in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

The hallucination includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.

The target can use its action to examine the hallucination with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your force power save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the hallucination is an illusion, and the power ends.

While a target is affected by the power, the target treats the hallucination as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the hallucination. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall - it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.

An affected target is so convinced of the hallucination's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A hallucination created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a hallucination created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the hallucination can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the hallucination's area or within 5 feet of the hallucination, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

You project a phantasmal image of a creature's worst fears. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become frightened for the duration. This power has no effect on constructs or droids.

While frightened by this power, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the power ends for that creature.

You can't control any object larger than Huge. Each object animates and hovers near you, remaining within 100 feet of you for the duration. An animated object behaves as though it is was a construct, with AC, hit points, and attacks determined by its size, and a flying speed of 30 feet.

As a bonus action, you can mentally direct any object controlled by this power. If you control multiple objects, you can command any or all of them at the same time. You decide what action the object will take and where it will move. The objects act at the end of your turn. If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and kinetic damage determined by its size.

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and influence with the Force up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to harm itself automatically negates the effect of the power.

Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the power ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn't met before the power ends, the activity isn't performed. If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this power, the power ends for that creature. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a 7th-level force slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level force slot, the duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-level force slot, the duration is a year and a day.

#### Master Force Immunity
_8th-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Improved Force Immunity
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot-radius sphere)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A 10-foot-radius faintly shimmering barrier surrounds you. Within the sphere, powers can't be cast and enhanced items become mundane. Until the power ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.

Powers and other enhanced effects are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed power is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

***Targeted Effects.*** Powers and other enhanced effects that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.

***Enhanced Areas.*** The area of another power or enhanced effect, such as _force storm_, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an enhanced area, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.

***Powers.*** Any active power or other enhanced effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

***Enhanced Items.*** The properties and powers of enhanced items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 vibrosword in the sphere functions as an unenhanced vibrosword.

An enhanced weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If an enhanced weapon or a piece of enhanced ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire an enhanced shot or throw an enhanced saberspear at a target outside the sphere), the enhancement of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

***Enhanced Travel.*** Teleportation fails to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such enhanced travel. A portal to another location temporarily closes while in the sphere.

***Creatures and Objects.*** A creature or object summoned or created by powers temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.

***Tech Override/Sever Force.*** Powers and enhanced effects such as *sever force* have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different scrambling field powers don't nullify each other.

A whirlwind howls down to a point that you can see on the ground within range. The whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that point.

The whirlwind sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and that aren't worn or carried by anyone.

A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or that the whirlwind enters its space, including when the whirlwind first appears. A creature takes 10d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlwind until the power ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside it, unless the creature is at the top. A restrained creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the power ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft.

A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your force save DC. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlwind and is hurled 3d6x10 feet away from it in a random direction.
