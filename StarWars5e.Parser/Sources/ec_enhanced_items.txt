#### Fine Restraining Bolt
_<font style="color:green">Adventuring gear, premium</font>_

Restraining bolts are small, cylindrical devices that can be affixed to a droid in order to limit its functions and enforce its obedience. When inserted, a restraining bolt restricts the droid from any movement its master does not desire, and also forced it to respond to signals produced by a hand-held control unit.

Installing a restraining bolt takes 1 minute. The droid must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A hostile droid makes this save with advantage. On a successful save, the restraining bolt overloads and is rendered useless. On a failed save, the restraining bolt is correctly installed, and the control unit can be used to actively control the droid. While the control unit is inactive, the droid can act freely but it can not attempt to remove the restraining bolt.

On a successful save, the restraining bolt overloads and is rendered useless.

#### Grenade, Gas (Average)
_<font style="color:green">Consumable (explosive), premium</font>_

Gas grenades are primarily used to flush enemies out of cover and other protected areas, though there are of course other uses. Grenades have a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. As an action, you can throw a grenade at a point you can see within range. The grenade explodes in a 15-foot-radius sphere of yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses it.

When a creature enters the fog's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 2d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is poisoned while it is in the cloud. Droids, constructs and humanoids wearing appropriate protective equipment are unaffected.

On a failed save, a creature takes 6d4 cold damage and has its speed reduced by half until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't slowed. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, that creature is frozen in carbonite for 1 hour.
