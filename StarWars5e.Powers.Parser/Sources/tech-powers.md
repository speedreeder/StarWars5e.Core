#### Guards and Wards
_6th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** 24 hours 

You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the power.

When you cast this power, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.

*Guards and wards* creates the following effects within the warded area.

***Corridors.*** Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.

***Doors.*** All doors in the warded area are locked, as if sealed by the *lock* power. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an image (equivalent to the illusory object function of the *minor image* power) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.

***Stairs.*** Electromesh fills all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the *electromesh* power. This mesh regrows in 10 minutes if it is burned or torn away while *guards and wards* lasts.

***Other power Effect.*** You can place your choice of one of the following enhanced effects within the warded area of the stronghold.
- Place *mobile lights* in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as *guards and wards* lasts.
- Place *implant message* in two locations.
- Place *debilitating gas* in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while *guards and wards* lasts.

The whole warded area radiates power. A *dimish tech* cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.

You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this power there every day for one year.

_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you take acid, cold, energy, fire, ion, kinetic, lightning, or sonic damage
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 round

The power captures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on you and storing it for your next melee attack. You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type, and the power ends.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a power slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Acid Dart
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

A shimmering green dart streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged tech attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the dart splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Acid Splash
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You emit a burst of acid. Choose one creature within range, or choose two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage.

This power's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).



#### Alarm
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the power ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the power, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible. 

A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.

#### Analyze
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the power. If it is an enhanced or modified item, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any powers are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a power, you learn which power created it.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what tech powers, if any, are currently affecting it.

#### Antipathy/Sympathy
_8th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 60 feet 
- **Duration:** 10 days

This power attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as rancors, kath hounds, or twi'leks. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.

***Antipathy.*** The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.

***Sympathy.*** The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the target. 

If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

***Ending the Effect.*** If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as unnatural. In addition, a creature affected by the power is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the power persists.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Duration:** 1 hour

An immobile, Invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of energy springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box as you choose.

A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any powers cast into or out of the area.

When you cast the power, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.

A creature inside the cage can't leave it by unenhanced means. If the creature tries to teleport to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that power to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the power or effect. 

This power can't be dispelled.

#### Carbonite
_6th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet

You attempt to freeze one creature that you can see within range into carbonite. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn't affected. 

A creature restrained by this power must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this power three times, the power ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

If the creature is physically broken while frozen in carbonite, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.

If you maintain your concentration on this power for the entire possible duration, the creature is frozen in carbonite until the effect is removed.

Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two powers. 

The contingent power takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then contingency ends.

The contingent power takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one contingency power at a time. If you cast this power again, the effect of another contingency power on you ends. Also, contingency ends on you if your wristpad is ever not on your person.

If the creature attempts to cast a power with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the power doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the power. If it can't, the power is wasted.

Each creature that starts its turn in the mesh or that enters it during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the mesh or until it breaks free.

For the duration, as long as you are on the same planet as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot cone)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your wristpad. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Flaming Shots
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You channel tech power through a blaster weapon you are wielding. When a target takes damage from the chosen weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The power ends when twelve shots have been fired.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the number of shots you can take with this power increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Freedom of Movement
_4th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and powers can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.

The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target's movement or attacks.

#### Gleaming Outline
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the power is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.

#### Greater Explosion
_9th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 

You expell a massive explosion at a point within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 40d6 fire damage and is knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one but remain standing.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

#### Greater Image
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an image no larger than a 20 foot cube. It appears at a spot you can see and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, sounds and other sensory effects included. You can't create a sensory effect strong enough to cause damage or a condition.

As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to make the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter it so that its movements appear natural for the image.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it as an illusion. A creature can use its action to determine that it's an illusion with a successful Investigation check. If a creature learns it's an illusion, it can see through the image, and the other sensory qualities become faint to it.

***Overcharge Tech.*** The power lasts until dispelled without requiring concentration if cast at 6th-level or higher.

#### Greater Light
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60
- **Duration:** 1 hour 

A 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads from a point you choose. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.

If you chose an object you are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the light shines from and moves with the object. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light.

If any of this power's area overlaps with enhanced darkness made by a power of 3rd level or lower, the darkness is dispelled.

#### Greater Sabotage Charges
_7th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create six medium sabotage charges that last for the power's duration. When you cast the power, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can hurl up to two of the charges to points you choose within 120 feet. Each charge explodes if it reaches the point or hits a solid surface. Each creature within 10 feet of the explosion must make a Dexterity save. The explosion deals 4d6 fire damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

***Overcharge Tech.*** The number of charges created increases by two for each slot level above 7th.

#### Greater Salvo 
_9th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You launch four projectiles at points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius  must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.

The power damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

#### Greater Translocate
_5th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your form shimmers in a holographic configuration, and then collapses. You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. On each of your turns before the power ends, you can use a bonus action to teleport in this way again.

#### Group Image
_5th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** 8 hours 

This power allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this power.

The power disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The power lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.

The changes wrought by this power fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this power to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this power to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

#### Guards and Wards
_6th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** 24 hours 

You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the power.

When you cast this power, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.

*Guards and wards* creates the following effects within the warded area.

***Corridors.*** Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.

***Doors.*** All doors in the warded area are locked, as if sealed by the *lock* power. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an image (equivalent to the illusory object function of the *minor image* power) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.

***Stairs.*** Electromesh fills all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the *electromesh* power. This mesh regrows in 10 minutes if it is burned or torn away while *guards and wards* lasts.

***Other power Effect.*** You can place your choice of one of the following enhanced effects within the warded area of the stronghold.
- Place *mobile lights* in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as *guards and wards* lasts.
- Place *implant message* in two locations.
- Place *debilitating gas* in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while *guards and wards* lasts.

The whole warded area radiates power. A *dimish tech* cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.

You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this power there every day for one year.

#### Hold Droid
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You emit a paralyzing dart at a droid or construct that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the power ends on the target.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional droid or construct for each slot level above 2nd. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

#### Hunter's Mark
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 

You choose a creature you can see within range and mark it as your quarry. Until the power ends, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, and you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find it. If the target drops to 0 hit points before this power ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your concentration on the power for up to 8 hours. When you use a tech slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on the power for up to 24 hours.

#### Image
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an image that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual. If anything passes through it, it is revealed to be an illusion.

You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image.

A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.


#### Immolate
_5th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for the power's duration. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, and the power ends on a successful one. These enhanced flames can't be extinguished by unenhanced means.

If damage from this power kills a target, the target is turned to ash.

#### Implant Message
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the power to deliver your message.

When that circumstance occurs, the message is recited in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. When you cast this power, you can have the power end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.

The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the message to play when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a bell rings within 30 feet of it.

#### Incendiary Cloud
_8th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You create a swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the power's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.

#### Infiltrate
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A creature you touch becomes invisible. Anything the target is carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target. The power ends if the target that attacks or casts a power.

***Overcharge Tech.*** You can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Invisibility to Cameras
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Up to four creatures of your choice become undetectable to electronic sensors and cameras. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is also undetectable, so long as it's on the target's person. The target is still visible to regular vision.

_9th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

You create a blast of ion energy. Choose one creature within range, or choose two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 ion damage. Droids and constructs have disadvantage on this saving throw.

This power's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

#### Ionic Bond
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

A beam of ion energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained line between you and the target. Make a ranged tech attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 ion damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use a bonus action to deal 1d8 ion damage to the target automatically. The power ends if you use your bonus action to do anything else. The power also ends if the target is ever outside the power's range or if it has total cover from you.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Jet of Flame
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot sphere)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The power ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the power. When you cast this power, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged tech attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

This power's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the power ends. If the power is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the powers ends.

#### Kolto Waves

- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 

A flood of kolto energy flows from you into injured creatures around you. You restore up to 700 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures that you can see within range.

#### Light
_At-will tech power_

- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the power ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The power ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the power.

#### Lock
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this power can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this power for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the power is dispelled or suppressed. Casting *release* on the object suppresses *lock* for 10 minutes.

While affected by this power, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.

#### Minor Image
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Duration:** Up to 1 hour

This ability is a minor tech trick that creates one of the following effects within range.
- You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor. 
- You instantaneously light or snuff out a source of light. 
- You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot. 
- You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour. 
- You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour. 
- You create a trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn. 

If you use this power multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

#### Mirror Image
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 minute

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the power ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the power's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.

A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The power ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this power if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight. 


#### Mislead
_5th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a power.

You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

#### Mobile Lights
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this power, and a light winks out if it exceeds the power's range.

Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the power. Until the power ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.

If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Overload
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot cube)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You expel a burst of power. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 fire damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

You touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into the immediate future. For the duration, the target can't be surprised and has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

This power immediately ends if you cast it again before its duration ends.

#### Programmed Illusion
_6th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the power how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.

When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.

The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

#### Project Image
_7th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 500 miles
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 24 hours

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the power ends.

You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

#### Protection from Energy
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 

For the duration, the willing creature you touch has resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or sonic.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose an area of unenhanced flame that you can see and that fits within a 5-foot cube within range. You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either fireworks or smoke when you do so.

***Smoke.*** Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.

#### Release
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 

Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of binders, a lock, or another object that contains a mundane or enhanced means that prevents access.

A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.

If you choose a target that is held shut with *lock*, that power is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.

#### Repair Droid
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 

A droid or construct you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your techcasting ability modifier. This power only effects droids and constructs.

#### Rime Strike 
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 90 feet 
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 

You imbue your weapon with cold energy. As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a ranged attack with a weapon against one creature within the power's range, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and the creature's movement speed is halved until the end of its turn as the air around it turns frigid. 

At 5th level the ranged attack deals an extra 1d8 cold damage. This damage increases by 1d8 again at 11th level and 17th level.

#### Ring of Fire
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** Self 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  

A wall of flames erupts out of the ground in a ring around you with a radius of 15 feet and a height of 10 feet. Creatures who start their turn in the ring of fire or pass through it on their turn take 1d6 fire damage. Creatures within the ring of fire who willingly try to move through the fire to escape must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to do so. Creatures who are immune to fear or fire automatically succeed on this saving throw. 

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage of the ring of fire increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Sabotage Charges
_3rd-level tech power_

When you cast the power, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can hurl up to two of the charges to points you choose within 120 feet. Each charge explodes if it reaches the point or hits a solid surface. Each creature within 5 feet of the explosion must make a Dexterity save. The explosion deals 2d6 fire damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

***Overcharge Tech.*** The number of charges created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Salvo
_4th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet (20-foot sphere)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You launch a projectile at a point you can see within range. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The power damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 5thy level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Scorching Ray
_2nd-level tech power_
___

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Scrambling Field
_8th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 acion
- **Range:** Self (10-foot-radius sphere)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A 10-foot-radius shimmering sphere of power suppression surrounds you. Within the sphere, powers can't be cast and enhanced items become mundane. Until the power ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.

Powers and other enhanced effects are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed power is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

***Targeted Effects.*** Powers and other enhanced effects that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.

***Enhanced Areas.*** The area of another power or enhanced effect, such as _explosion_, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an enhanced area, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.

***Powers.*** Any active power or other enhanced effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

***Enhanced Items.*** The properties and powers of enhanced items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 lightsaber in the sphere functions as an unenhanced lightsaber.

An enhanced weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If an enhanced weapon or a piece of enhanced ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire an enhanced shot or throw an enhanced vibrospear at a target outside the sphere), the enhancement of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

***Enhanced Travel.*** Teleportation fails to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such enhanced travel. A portal to another location temporarily closes while in the sphere.

***Creatures and Objects.*** A creature or object summoned or created by powers temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.

***Tech Override/Sever Force.*** Powers and enhanced effects such as *tech override* have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different scrambling field powers don't nullify each other.

#### Scrambling Shield
_6th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot radius)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.

Any tech power of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the power is cast using a higher level tech slot. Such a power can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the power has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such powers.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks powers of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.

#### Sending
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Unlimited
- **Duration:** 1 round 

You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar that possesses a commlink. The creature hears the message, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. 

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planets, but if the target is on a different planet than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive.

#### Sensor Probe
_4th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create a small, temporary, invisible probe that hovers in the air for the duration. You mentally receive visual information from the probe. It has darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction.

As an action, you can move the probe up to 30 feet in any direction. There's no limit on how far away from you it can be. A solid barrier blocks the probe's movement, but it can pass through an opening at least 1 inch in diameter.

#### Shared Shielding
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** 1 hour

This power wards a willing creature you touch and creates an energy link between you and the target until the power ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.

The power ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the power is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the power as an action.

#### Shatter
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 

A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 sonic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

An unenhanced object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the power's area.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Shutdown 
_5th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your wristpad emits an EMP, shutting down all electronic devices, with the exception of your wristpad, that are not held by or under the direct control of a creature. If it is, the creature must succeed  on an Intelligence saving throw to stop the device from being shut down. While the power is active, no electronic device in range can be started or restarted.

#### Slow-Release Medpac
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

Kolto energy radiates from you in an aura with a 30-foot radius. Until the power ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. You can use a bonus action to cause one creature in the aura (including you) to regain 2d6 hit points.

_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can't be tracked except by enhanced means. You can choose yourself as well. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no traces of its passage.

#### Spot the Weakness
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up 1 minute

Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make Dexterity saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the power ends, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

#### Storming Shot
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

As a part of the action used to cast this power, you must make an attack with a ranged weapon against one creature within the power's range, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects and gains the lightning rod debuff until the end of your next turn, as energy begins to course through them. When this power hits a target, if there is a creature within 30 ft who has the lightning rod debuff, then the energy discharges, creating an arc of lightning between them which removes the debuff and deals 1d6 lightning damage to each of them.

The power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the effects of both the ranged weapon attack and discharge deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage. Both damage rolls increase by an additional 1d6 at 11th and 17th level.

#### Stun
_8th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 ation
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You emit a tiny dart imbued with paralysis at a target within range. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the power has no effect.

The stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.

#### Supercharged Gas
_7th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You release a series of darts filled with supercharged gas. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. Each creature  must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based on its current hit points:

- 60 hit points or fewer: poisoned for 1 minute
- 50 hit points or fewer: poisoned and deafened for 1 minute
- 40 hit points or fewer: poisoned, deafened, and blinded for 10 minutes
- 30 hit points or fewer: poisoned, blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 hour
- 20 hit points or fewer: killed instantly

This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

#### Synchronicity
_4th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A creature you touch isn't inconvenienced by mundane delays. Traffic lights are always green, there's always a waiting elevator, and a taxi is always around the corner. The target can run at full speed through dense crowds and attacks of opportunity provoked by the target's movement are made with disadvantage.

The power also grants advantage to stealth checks, since cover is always available. Additionally, the target has advantage on all ability checks made to drive a vehicle.

If two or more creatures under the effect of the power are attempting to avoid being inconvenienced by each other, the creatures make Charisma checks each time the effects would oppose each other. The higher check of the two's power takes effect.

#### Tactical Advantage
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the power ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.

When the power ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.

#### Tactical Barrier

Choose up to two willing creatures that you can see within range.

That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or the Use an Object Action. 

When the power ends, each target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 8th-level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 7th.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the power creates one more explosive for each slot level above 1st.

#### Tech Override
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a tech power. If the creature is casting a power of 3rd level or lower, its power fails and has no effect. If it is casting a power of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your techcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the power's level. On a success, the creature's power fails and has no effect.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted power has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the force slot you used.

#### Temporary Boost
_At-will tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch one willing creature. Once before the power ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The power then ends.

#### Toxic Cloud
_5th-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the power. Its area is heavily obscured.

When a creature enters the power's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.

The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.

#### Toxin Purge
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** 1 hour 

You touch a creature. If it is poisoned or diseased, you neutralize the poison or disease. If more than one poison or disease afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison or disease that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.

For the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned or diseased, and it has resistance to poison damage.

#### Toxin Scan
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:**	1 action 
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:**	Concentration, up to 10 minutes

- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** 1 round

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Tracker Droid Interface
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You interface a tracker droid with your wristpad, creating a permanent link. 

Your tracker droid acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A tracker droid can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

While your tracker droid is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it via your wristpad. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your droid's vision and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the droid has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

You can't maintain an interface between more than one tracker droid and your wristpad at a time. 

Finally, when you cast a tech power with a range of touch, your tracker can deliver the power as if it had cast it. Your tracker droid must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the power when you cast it. If the power requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, you can maintain a link with one more tracker droid for every two slot levels above 1st. Multiple tracker droids act on the same initiative. You can only see through one droid's vision at a time, but you can toggle between droids as a bonus action. Each droid must still be within 100 feet of you.

#### Tranquilizer
_1st-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet

You emit a tranquilizing dart that knocks a creature unconscious. Roll 5d8; if the creature's remaining hit points are less than the total, the creature falls unconscious until the power ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target an additional creature for each slot level above 1st. For each target, roll 5d8 separately.

At 5th level, the ranged attack deals an extra 1d6 energy damage to the target. This extra damage increases by 1d6 again at 11th level and 17th level.

#### Ward

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
