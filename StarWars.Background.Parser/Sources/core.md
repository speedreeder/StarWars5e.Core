## Agent
Many organizations active in the galaxy aren't bound by strictures of geography. These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, mercenaries, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or items for use by the faction's operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don't merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, and heart. As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own. Becoming an adventurer doesn't necessarily require you to relinquish membership in your faction (though you can choose to do so), and it might enhance your status in the faction.

### Feature: Safe Haven
As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.

## Bounty Hunter 
Before you became an adventurer, your life was already full of conflict and excitement, because you made a living tracking down people for pay. Unlike some people who collect bounties, though, you aren't a savage who follows quarry into or through the wilderness. You’re involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. What's more, you aren't alone, as a bounty hunter in the wild would be: you routinely interact with both the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining contacts in both areas to help you succeed.\n\nYou might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of the city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of street gangs. You might be a "velvet mask" bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists. As a member of an adventuring party, you might find it more difficult to pursue a personal agenda that doesn't fit with the group's objectives - but on the other hand, you can take down much more formidable targets with the help of your companions.

| 5 | I retreated once, and I've regretted it ever since. |
| 6 | I value a victory regardless of the ethics behind the victory.|

## Mercenary
As a sell-sword who fought battles for coin, you're well acquainted with risking life and limb for a chance at a share of treasure. Now, you look forward to fighting foes and reaping even greater rewards as an adventurer. Your experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of events on the battlefield. You might have served with a large outfit or a smaller band of sell-swords, maybe even more than one. \n\nNow you're looking for something else, perhaps greater reward for the risks you take, or the freedom to choose your own activities. For whatever reason, you're leaving behind the life of a soldier for hire, but your skills are undeniably suited for battle, so now you fight on in a different way.

### Feature: Mercenary Life
You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can. You are able to identify mercenary companies by their emblems, and you know a little about any such company, including the names and reputations of its commanders and leaders, and who has hired them recently. You can find the cantinas and feasthalls where mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the language, and if you spend at least an hour in such a location you can come across one of the following bits of information: a job offer, significant rumor, referal to a skilled merchant, blacksmith, etc., or a hint towards the pursuit of your current quest. Additionally, you can find mercenary work between adventures sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle (see "Practicing a Profession" under "Downtime Activities" in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook).

## Noble
You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with manual labor, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land.\n\nWork with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries, as well as your family and their influence on you. Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, how do people regard them?\n\nWhat’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family or the head itself? Are you far down the line of succession? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?\n\nDoes your family have a coat of arms you might wear, a signet ring, or particular colors? \n\nThese details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Insight, Lore, and Persuasion
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a letter of pedigree, and a purse containing 250 cr

### Feature: Position of Privilege
Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.

### Background Feat
As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:

|2|Empathic|
|3|Loremaster|
|4|Charming Persona|
|5|Entertaining Competitor|
|6|Linguist|
|7|Inspiring Leader|
|8|Observant|

#### Suggested Characteristics
Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family’s care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.

|2|The common folk love me for my kindness and generosity.|

|5|I don’t like to get my hands dirty, and I won’t be caught dead in unsuitable accommodations. |
|6|Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other folk. We all have the same blood.|
|7|My favor, once lost, is lost forever.|
|8|If you do me an injury, I will crush you, ruin your name, and salt your fields.|

|d6|Ideal|
|:---:|:----------|
|1|**Respect**. Respect is due to me because of my position, but all people regardless of station deserve to be treated with dignity. (Light)|
|2|**Responsibility**. It is my duty to respect the authority of those above me, just as those below me must respect mine. (Lawful)|
|3|**Independence**. I must prove that I can handle myself without the coddling of my family. (Chaotic)|
|4|**Power**. If I can attain more power, no one will tell me what to do. (Dark)|
|5|**Family**. Blood runs thicker than water. (Any)|
|6|**Noble Obligation**. It is my duty to protect and care for the people beneath me. (Light)|

|d6|Bond|

|3|I too often hear veiled insults and threats in every word addressed to me, and I’m quick to anger.|
|4|I have an insatiable desire for carnal pleasures.|
|5|In fact, the world does revolve around me.|
|6|By my words and actions, I often bring shame to my family.|

## Scientist
Nothing excites you more than pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge. Most of your time is spent in a lab performing experiments to further your interests. Few people understand the work you do. You can solve complex problems most people can't begin to wrap their heads around, and can solve simple problems in unexpected ways that surprise most people. \n\nWhat is your scientific field of interest? Is it your insatiable curiousity, or a personal goal that drives you? Did you leave your lab voluntarily, or were you kicked out? One thing is for sure - there are too many interesting research ideas, and too little time.

| 5 | I believe I work better when under the influence of intoxicants. |

## Scoundrel
You have always had a way with people. You can tease out their heart’s desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read them like they were children's books. It’s a useful talent, and one that you’re perfectly willing to use for your advantage. You know what people want and you promise to deliver, coaxing people into otherwise foolish decisions. You make the improbable sound plausible, and come ahead on every deal.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Insight, Performance, and Sleight of Hand
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Disguise Kit, Forgery Kit

|5|Master of Disguise|
|6|Force of Personality|
|7|Snappy Interjection|
|8|Actor|

#### Suggested Characteristics 
Scoundrels are colorful characters who conceal their true selves behind the masks they construct. They reflect what people want to see, what they want to believe, and how they see the world. But their true selves are sometimes plagued by an uneasy conscience, an old enemy, or deep-seated trust issues.

## Sith
You are an acolyte of the Sith Order: an ancient order of Force-wielders devoted to the dark side of the Force. Emerging as a divergent faction to the Jedi Order, the Sith are mortal enemies of the Jedi and fight against them. Driven by emotions such as hate, anger, and greed, the Sith are deceptive and ultimately obsessed with amassing power no matter the cost. You follow the Sith Code:\n\n*"Peace is a lie. There is only passion.*\n*Through passion I gain strength.*\n*Through strength I gain power.*\n*Through power I gain victory.*\n*Through victory my chains are broken.*\n*The Force shall free me."*

As a Sith, you instill fear in those who are aware of your standing. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at any Sith temple, and those who are aware of your nature will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.\n\nYou might also have ties to a specific Sith temple and have a residence there. This could be the temple where you trained, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the Sith for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for benefits them and you remain in good standing with your temple.

|7|Force of Personality|
|8|Force Sensitive|

#### Suggested Characteristics
Sith are shaped by their training. They study the Sith code and use it to oppress the weak and quell resistance. Their study of the Sith code affects their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

|1|I idolize a particular Sith, and constantly refer to that person’s deeds and example.|

## Smuggler
You have spent your life hiding in the darkness, making shady deals behind closed doors. What led you to engage in a life of crime? Do you crave the thrill of lawbreaking, or did you enter the profession to pay off a debt, risking your hide on behalf of a less than honorable noble? A smuggler is an individual trained in the art of acquisition, a professional thug who can deliver anything... for a price. Smugglers tend to be more bolder criminals than most, preferring bribery or distraction over subterfuge and stealth.
___
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from Deception, Piloting, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set and your choice of demolitions kit, security kit, or slicer's kit
- **Equipment:** A crowbar, a set of dark common clothes including a hood, and a belt pouch containing 150 cr

### Feature: Careful Selection
Some close brushes with the law have taught you that not every city guard can be bribed, and some people are simply too keen to miss minute discrepancies. This feature allows you to study a person and gain insight into whether or not they would accept a bribe, or to pick up on whether they are exceptionally more perceptive than you. It does not reveal how expensive a bribe may be for a given situation, however.

### Background Feat
As a further embodiment of the experience and training of your background, you can choose from the following feats:

|d8|Feat|

|4|Stealthy|
|5|Entertaining Competitor|
|6|Demolitionist|
|7|Bypasser|
|8|Slicer|

#### Suggested Characteristics
Smugglers might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are nefarious to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but spies rarely show any respect for law or authority. 

|d8|Personality Trait|
|:---:|:----------|
|1|I am extremely sociable, especially over a mug of ale.|
|2|I always keep my wares close to me, you never know who might stumble across them otherwise.|
|3|The best way to hide is out in the open.|
|4|I'm a terrible gossip.|
|5|Being seen with any unsavory figures is a sure way to undermine my work, which is why I work out of sight.|
|6|Deflecting questions has become second nature to me, so I rarely answer straight.|
|7|I have dozens of identities and live in constant fear of answering to the wrong name.|
|8|I act irrationally confident in the face of danger, nobody suspects anything when you seem like you're in charge.|

|d6|Ideal|
|:---:|:----------|
|1|**Morals.** I only smuggle things to improve the lives of the common folk. (Light)|
|2|**Ruthless.** I will rise to the top of the heap by any means necessary. (Dark)|
|3|**Friendship.** My associates are dear to me, and I want them to rise with me when I hit it big. (Lawful)|
|4|**Dauntless.** No border crossing or bribe is too difficult- that's just the coward's way of saying exciting! (Chaotic)|
|5|**Greater.** Good I work for a greater cause, and ply my trade only in service to it. (Any)|
|6|**Unperturbed.** I only want to make a living for myself, and smuggling is just an edge I can use to do so. (Neutral)|

|d6|Bond|
|:---:|:----------|
|1|A corrupt official shut me down back in my honest days. I aim to show him a thing or two about recovery.|
|2|I never wanted to be a criminal, but it pays the bills.|
|3|A bloodthirsty pirate stole a shipment from me and killed a dear friend of mine. I will have my vengeance.|
|4|Someone I cared about discovered my profession and has publicly denounced me, and I am caught between protecting my reputation and restoring our relationship.|
|5|My love interest is someone who once stole from right under my nose- but they have no idea who I am or how much I admire them for their accomplishment.|
|6|My business partners are closer to me than my family.|

|d6|Flaw|
|:---:|:----------|
|1|"Trust nobody, not even yourself." I am plagued by paranoia.|
|2|I'm so charismatic that sometimes I woo myself. Who am I, Narcissus?|
|3|Money is my greatest motivator. I'll do almost anything given enough of it, even if I'll regret it later.|
|4|I would betray anyone to save my own skin.|
|5|I detach myself from the results of my actions in order to sleep better at night.|
|6|Someone who knows me well might call me "two-faced" but those who don't have no idea what hit 'em.|

## Soldier
War has been your life for as long as you care to remember. You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You might have been part of a standing national army, a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.\n\nWhen you choose this background, work with your DM to determine which military organization you were a part of, how far through its ranks you progressed, and what kind of experiences you had during your military career. Was it a standing army, a town guard, a village militia, or perhaps a private company.
___

|2|Scout|
|3|Infantry|
|4|Medic|
|5|Quartermaster|
|6|Pilot|
|7|Artisan|
|8|Support Staff|

### Feature: Military Rank
You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments where your rank is recognized.
